# Supporting an asexual person

[*Back to wiki main page.*](w/asexuality/index)

----------
Understanding an asexual person better is by far easiest way to start helping them. If you read everything on this wiki you may end up knowing more about asexuality than even they do, so you have the tools to start supporting them right now.

The role of supportive friends, family, or partners cannot be understated.

Dos:

* The most important rule when it comes to supporting someone is to recognise that they are the expert on whatever is going on in their own head. Sexuality is confusing and each person relates to it differently, so don't expect to be able to put others into a neat box.

* Educating yourself on asexuality is one of the easiest and most impactful things you can do.

* Often, just listening to someone is really helpful, even if it doesn't seem that way. Remember that we are all human, and we're all just trying to get by in this world in whatever way we know how. We may not understand exactly how other people feel, but things like happiness, sadness, fear, etc. are universal.

* Be as sensitive when talking about sexual habits as you would when talking to anyone else. Curiosity is good, but try to remember that it's a human being you're talking to.

Top six things **not** to say:

* "Do you masturbate?" – You wouldn't ask a gay person about their masturbation habits.
* "You'll find 'the one' and change your mind." / "Have sex with me, it'll be different." – This is denying that asexuality is real.
* "I wish I were asexual as well." / "How can I become asexual?" – This is insensitive to the struggles that many asexuals suffer through in silence.
* "It's probably just because you have been abused, I don't think you’re asexual." – You don't know how someone feels better than they do. Suggesting otherwise is toxic.
* "You have no idea what you’re missing out on." – This is very insensitive.
* "That’s a real shame because you’re so hot." – This subtly frames asexuals as being inferior or somehow defective.

## An asexual perspective
Despite not seeming like it from the outside, being asexual can have implications for many aspects of a person's life. Like other sexual minorities, asexuals face problems with being understood (even among the LGBT+ community) and with trying to work out how they fit in a world that doesn't vindicate their orientation in any way. Many asexuals go through a period of feeling like they must be broken, or are even told so, sometimes by medical professionals. In addition, they may find themselves unable to contribute to a conversation, connect with those around them, or enjoy aspects of media and culture, etc., which can create a feeling of being irreconcilably separated from others. It doesn't help that our culture often promotes the idea that only people who have sex can – for one reason or another – be happy in life.^1

There are also some more insidious factors at play. A 2012 study published in *Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations* reported that asexuals are evaluated more negatively in terms of prejudice, dehumanisation and discrimination than other sexual minorities, such as gay men, lesbians and bisexuals: both homosexual and heterosexual people thought of asexuals as not only cold, but also animalistic and unrestrained. As is common among LGBT+ people, asexuals are at a heightened risk of mental health issues, in particular depression and anxiety disorders. They can also struggle to form healthy intimate relationships, which can impact their well-being directly, but also later in life many asexuals see their friends slip away as they prioritise romantic relationships over friendship. According to a 2016 survey, 50% of asexual people have "seriously considered suicide" and 14% have attempted suicide.

The struggles that come with being asexual are compounded by the fact they cannot always rely on having a supportive community they can turn to. Similar to the hate that bisexual and trans people sometimes experience from the LGBT+ community, asexual people are sometimes victims of ostracism from the very groups that are supposed to protect them. Many asexuals avoid LGBT+ spaces – with fear being cited as the most common reason – and most asexuals have no access to offline communities dedicated to asexuality. This makes the role of supportive friends and family is all the more important, because there is a good chance an asexual has no safety-net.

All of these things can understandably have an effect on a person's view of the world and of themselves, and well as forcing them – to varying degrees – to become a certain way in order to cope. Ultimately, one of the most important things that can be given to an asexual is the feeling of normality. Asexuality is rare, at 1% of the population, and even when it's around it's invisible, so sometimes it can feel like no one in the world understands you; but at the end of the day, each and every person is valid, important, and good enough – regardless of their sexuality.
