# How can I become asexual?

[*Back to FAQ index.*](w/asexuality/faq)

---

There's no method to become asexual: asexuality isn't a choice, it's a sexual orientation (defined as a lack of attraction towards anyone). Asking to become asexual is no less absurd than asking to become homosexual. You're welcome to stick around in this subreddit and learn about asexuality if you want, but we won't be able to offer you any help in changing your sexuality.
