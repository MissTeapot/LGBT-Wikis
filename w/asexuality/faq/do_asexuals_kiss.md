# Do asexual people like kissing?

[*Back to FAQ index.*](w/asexuality/faq)

---

Some asexuals enjoy kissing, and some don't.

Kissing may or may not be considered a romantic or sensual gesture (rather than a sexual one), meaning that some asexuals might be attracted towards kissing others. Such feelings do not necessarily imply sexual desire.

Separately, similar to sex-repulsion and -favourability, an asexual person (or indeed any person) may enjoy the sensation of kissing without experiencing any intrinsic urge to kiss any particular people.
