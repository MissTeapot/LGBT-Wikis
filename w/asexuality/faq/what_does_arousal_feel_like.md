# What does arousal feel like?

[*Back to FAQ index.*](w/asexuality/faq)

Sexual arousal is composed two different phenomenon that do not necessarily occur at the same time: psychological arousal and physiological arousal.

### Physiological arousal

Physiological arousal refers to unconscious bodily changes that occur as a result of or in preparation for sexual activity. Physiological arousal can occur even in cases there isn't consent, or (in particular with respect to erections) as a response to non-sexual arousal. Examples common to both sexes include:

* an accelerated heart rate and/or blood pressure;
* faster breathing;
* heightened sensitivity, in particular to touch;
* pupil dilation;
* erect nipples.

Some effects are particular to people with male anatomy:

* an erect penis;
* emission of pre-ejaculate.

Some effects are particular to people with female anatomy:

* feeling hot or flushed;^1
* engorged sexual tissues (e.g. nipples, vulva, clitoris, vaginal walls);
* vaginal lubrication.^2

### Psychological arousal

Psychological arousal on the other hand, refers to self-reported feelings of arousal and/or the desire to participate in sexual activities (alone or with partners). While physiological arousal correlates with psychological arousal, it is not uncommon for them to occur separately [1].

In particular, it is not uncommon for a man to get an erection without being psychologically aroused. Mechanical stimulation alone can result in an erection – for example, male rape victims may report having an erection. There is also "nocturnal penile tumescence", which is a largely unexplained effect where men get an erection during (or shortly after) sleep without any apparent cause.

Some forms of physiological arousal can also occur as a response to non-sexual arousal – for example aggression or excitement. This is particularly the case when it comes to erections.

### Footnotes

^1 This can also occur in men but it's less common and usually less intense. A female sex flush can extend over the chest and upper body.
