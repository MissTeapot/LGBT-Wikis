# Experiences

[*Back to wiki main page.*](w/asexuality/index)

-----

On this page you can find a collection of (lightly edited) quotes describing various experiences from a first-hand perspective. For example: how do non-asexuals describe the sexual attraction they feel? The intent here is to supplement and flesh-out the more 'high level' or 'theoretical' tone that the rest of this wiki typically uses – sometimes the best way to understand something is to go back to the source.

The experiences covered include sexual attraction, romantic love, coming out, and many other topics related to the a-spectra. The hope with these quotes is that you'll find either find something that speaks to you, something that makes you go "that's not me at all", or something that helps you understand where other people might be coming from. However, as with anything the experience of these things varies from person to person, so these quotes should not be taken to be definitive or overly representative. If you find that a perspective is missing or under-represented, just let us know as we'll see what we can do.

## Attraction

### Sexual attraction
The most common thing that allosexuals (i.e. non-asexuals) describe with sexual attraction is an urge to physically be as close as possible to the other person. It also common to hear about a 'positive feedback loop' where reciprocated attraction leads to the attraction feeling even stronger.

* &gt; It'll vary from allo to allo, but here's my cis male hetero experience. I am poly, with an ace wife and an allo girlfriend, and other occasional casual partners.
&gt; 
&gt; The trigger is almost always visual. My eyes are drawn of their own accord to their most feminine physical features. Usually the hips/waist curve. If she's not a current or potential partner I do my best to avoid eye contact, and mentally try to shut it down. You get pretty well practiced at keeping your desires under control after your teens, but if it's safe to secretly admire her, I might not try so hard. I'll imagine what it would be like to hold her, or what she might look like naked, or whether she might find me attractive as well.
&gt; 
&gt; If she's a partner already, looks become less important; it's all about touch. I'll pet her, caress her, kiss her. Casually at first, like as an invitation. If it's welcomed, our mutual sexual desire builds on itself. It's like a reverberating echo, if I feel the desire reciprocated, my own intensifies.
&gt; 
&gt; With mounting intensity, I need to hold her close. Skin to skin contact. There is literally no feeling in the world for me like feminine skin. It's a delicious feedback loop. I need to touch her more, everywhere. Sound takes a step forward in its importance, her moaning in pleasure. Clothes get in the way. I need to wrap her around me. Oxytocin and dopamine flood my brain.
&gt; 
&gt; It's intense as fuck.

* &gt; As a demisexual, I will try to explain as best I can. Excuse the cake analogy, but it’s all I got. You can replace it with another food if you like.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s like when you see a cupcake that looks really really good and you want to eat it. It looks perfectly moist and that frosting is just so perfect I was to put it in my mouth to see what it tastes like. You can experience this desire whether or not you’re hungry (libido). You just feel drawn to it. Or it’s like seeing a really really soft, cute dog and you really really want to pet it.
&gt; 
&gt; So that’s attraction in general, and so sexual attraction is feeling that way about sex with a specific person. I remember the first time I felt sexual attraction to my now husband. It was just like when I saw a really yummy looking piece of food or a really cute animal, like a magnetic pull. But instead of eating a cupcake or petting a dog, I felt a desire to touch him sexually, and for him to do the same to me. As a demisexual, it was less about his looks and more about our emotional connection and intimacy. But still, it’s sexual attraction. Even when I’m not aroused or in the mood for sex, I still sometimes just look at him and want to squish his butt (or other things).
&gt; 
&gt; If you have never felt that desire, it might be hard to understand, just like it’s hard for someone who doesn’t like dogs to understand why you’d want to pet a dog, or a person who doesn’t like sweets to understand why you’d want to eat a cupcake. But I personally feel like all of these drives and desires feel very similar, just directed towards different things.

* &gt; OK. Cis straight allo female here.
&gt; 
&gt; The moment that stands out most to me, was with a friend I had a deep, intense crush on a few years ago. He often wore heavy sweaters or flannels. One evening, I looked up across the room to see him taking off his sweater, leaving his t-shirt on. His neck was sweaty. My eyes literally could not look away. I wanted to lick his neck, wrap my hand around it, run my hand down his neck to his shirt where it stuck to his chest. It was this all consuming feeling, I felt it in my gut, between my legs, tingling and just very aware of this feeling to, for lack of a better phrase, consume him. Meld my skin to his.
&gt; 
&gt; Another moment, we were cuddling on the sofa. There was a vibe. Sexual tension. We nearly kissed, then looked away. Then looked back and kissed. And then we couldn't stop. I just wanted to touch him, to feel his hands on me, peel off his shirt, get as close to his body as I could get my body. It's very, very visceral.

* &gt; I'm demisexual so my experience is different to that of an allosexual person but here's my grain of salt. Most of the time it's the feelings I experience for the other person (i.e love and feeling loved) that gets me going but I have moments here and there where I experience physical attraction (always tied to feelings of love, deep affection and trust).
&gt; 
&gt; For women, generally the curves of the breasts, thighs and buttocks, their general softness of form. With men, it's more directed toward the face; haircut, eyes, lips, jaw, neck, and collarbone, how they move, large shoulders. Skin in general and strengh in the embrace but the kind that makes you feel safe (men or women).
&gt; 
&gt; Aesthetically speaking, I can appreciate those too but if I look at it "right", it's like trying to imagine and feel how soft (skin wise), firm (presence/whole body wise) and warm (body heat) that person can be and wanting to hold them and touch them everywhere and be really close, envelop yourself in them and just be so close that at some point it devolves into sexual arousal. Sorry for the bluntness but I find myself wanting to kiss and lick them all over. It's a sort of pulling sensation from the chest in a way and heavy between the legs. And when unfilfilled (not being able to touch like I want) can get very constricting sometimes, like your own skin is too tight. But it's always a result of me being in love so that last part especially is probably different for allosexual people; I'm positive the too tight feeling I get is more an unfulfilled emotional need than a physical one. An unfulfilled sexual need is more irritating like hell than distressing (i.e anger and not sadness).
&gt; 
&gt; I heard an allo bi girl discussing the subject once and she said she walks up the street sometimes and just knows she'd be down to have sex with that person across the street like... now. But I can't relate to that, the most I get in these moments is aesthetic attraction (until they open their mouth and ruins it) so I wouldn't know how to describe to you pure sexual attraction or pleasurable casual sex. I've done it (long story) and it was sort of arousing in a very base physical way, in a 'someone's rubbing up against me right now' way similar to masturbation but there was no physical attraction there, mostly it was just mechanical, vaguely unpleasant and often disgusting afterwards so...

* &gt; I think I actually only really feel sexual attraction when I really really like a person (which rarely happens based on visual appearance and never solely on that). I also feel it based on actions like kissing for a long time or making out or hugging and feeling their boner if they have one. Or stuff like that. Also sometimes it just happens when I realize someone is a really great person. I guess that just starts my thought process and results in me realizing that I find them very sexually attractive. It actually doesn't really matter that much how they look like it's more important how they act and what we do.
&gt; 
&gt; I have no idea how to describe that though, it's just that I know that given the right circumstances I'd like to have sex with them. And it's also the urge to do it and to touch and kiss them.

* &gt; Well, for me, I'm very much into voices. I had the great privilege to know a woman with a deep husky voice. And in the interests of honesty, I found it very attractive to hear her talk. It feels like a rush to me. The first time, I felt quite excited by it and my heart beating a lot faster than it normally does.

* &gt; It's a very physical feeling that kind of arises out of nowhere. I suddenly feel a surge of energy, like I want to go for a sprint; my body suddenly feels warm inside and I feel a tiny bit out of breath. I have this intense craving to have this person as close to me as possible, to cuddle them intensely, but cuddling doesn't feel like remotely satisfying enough. I find myself imagining wrapping my arm around their waist and pulling them against me and French kissing them passionately. Everything downstairs (I'm a cis woman, for context) starts to feel extremely warm, literally, and a bit swollen feeling, and I become unusually aware of that area of my body. If the feeling is really intense, which happens during times of high libido, then I might have the overwhelming need to masturbate if that person isn't sexually available right then.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I can definitely feel milder forms of this, where these feelings are still there but significantly less intense. It's easier to notice them if I've felt strong ones recently. Sometimes romantic feelings happen simultaneously, sometimes not. Aesthetic attraction sometimes sparks it, sometimes not

### Romantic attraction

* &gt; This is really tough to describe! And it got long...
&gt; 
&gt; I've been in romantic love. And while for me, the whole "you know it when you feel it" thing was actually true, it's extremely difficult to put my experience into words. I consider myself demiromantic (if that's even a thing), so I have to have platonic/friend feelings for someone before those feelings can change to romantic ones. Romantic attraction is a bit of a misnomer for me.
&gt; 
Having said that, it was sort of a progression. I really liked this person as a friend, so yes, I cared for him, enjoyed spending time with him, we had mutual interests, we challenged each other, etc. It was almost a focus-shift. It's not that I became 'fixated' on one person—that's not quite right—but he started to occupy my thoughts more often, and I found myself intensely looking forward to being in his company.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, I always look forward to hanging out with my friends...but this was more of a longing to be in his presence, even if we weren't doing anything in particular. Being near him not only quelled this longing, it also brought a sense of warmth and comfort. Not quite like "oh, nothing bad can happen now, I'm safe"—more like a deep-rooted sense of calm. It's like my mind went, "Oh, good, it's you." We were very much kindred spirits, and the fact that I could recognize a lot of myself in another person—more so than any other platonic friend I've had—was really profound.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not a touchy-feely kind of person either; I'm okay with (and sometimes even genuinely enjoy) hugs from good friends and people I know well, but I rarely initiate, and I really value my personal space. But with this person, physical contact felt natural. I didn't even think about it; my aversion to touch simply wasn't a barrier with him, like it never existed at all. And when he reciprocated, my initial reaction wasn't to recoil, but rather to lean in. Again, like my soul went, "Oh, hello. It's you." I didn't mind being close because he almost felt like a physical extension of myself, if that makes sense. I craved his touch and his arms because it felt like coming home.
&gt; 
&gt; Seeing him and being near him did give me the proverbial 'butterflies.' Like little thrills of excitement and affection that started above my belly button and rose upward into my throat. Sometimes I would picture it as a sort of invisible force that radiated from me and surrounded him, and I liked to think he could feel that. The fact that he reciprocated my love—and that I could "feel" this in return—only fuelled the fire.
&gt; 
&gt; Trust, sitting contentedly in silence, serenity, no fear of judgment, etc...yes, I feel those things with my platonic friends too, and I value all of them just as much as I did with the person with whom I was in love. But with him, the type of love was different, felt different, felt deeper. (Note: Not better, just not the same.) I adore my friends, but I don't want to cuddle with them, I don't want to spend all my time with them, I generally need longer periods of introvert-recuperation time, I don't feel like they are extensions of myself. I feel safe and comfortable around them, but I don't get that same sense of oh, it's you. I miss them when I don't see them, but I don't yearn for them.
&gt; 
&gt; Brain chemicals, I guess, man? Basically, it's all weird. I hope this made sense.

* &gt; I think "A strong desire to spend time with the other person, and contentment doing just that regardless of the activity" is a lot of it for me. Craving the contentment and almost serenity of simply sitting in silence with the person you're attracted to, and just enjoying feeling their presence in the room is powerful. You don't have to be doing anything, and I get the sense that it can be more intense when that's all you're doing. Something I once heard and agree with is that it's the trust and willingness to be completely open with your partner, in a way you wouldn't be with anyone else. People who are more sure of their allo-ness, how'd I do?

* &gt; [In response the wiki's explanation of romanticism] Your points make total sense! For me it’s also a very weird feeling of the fact I can’t hate them, and I’m willing to put on effort to make things work. I had a crush on my friend (turns out he’s gay lmao) and I would totally accept to go out of my way for him. Like, take care of him if he’s sick or needs help, when I’d be shopping and I see something nice I’d say “oh I think he’ll like this!” And I think it would be nice to surprise with like a tiny cheap thing that I would think he’d like, if I went out shopping. And also, I told him a few times that I really can’t hate him even if I tried. Which is why I fought so hard to fix things when things between us got rough. He said he loves me too, and he cares for me. It’s confusing but he’s the first person I’ve liked in a very long time, and it was very weird for me. But I’m learning. And I hope I can become a stronger person. And now I’ve met this super cute mathematics student (I’m an engineering student) from a nearby college and I think I might be developing a sliiight crush on him. I’m excited to move on. But I still can’t shake off my feelings for the previous friend, mainly because we see each other fairly often and we enjoy each other’s company.

* &gt; Have you ever experienced that feeling when you're driving over hills and your stomach sort of goes wOOoooOoOOp?
&gt; 
&gt; That's what romantic "butterflies" feel like. Like you just went into freefall and your body hasn't caught up yet.
&gt; 
&gt; It can be a very pleasant feeling.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not really comparable to feeling sick, at least in my personal experience.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing that's different from platonic attraction is just how badly you want to be with that person.
&gt; 
&gt; Like there have been people that I REALLY want to be friends with, and you have this urge to get to know them and become closer. Dial that up to 100 and you get romantic feelings.
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than an urge, it feels like a need. You NEED to get to know that person. You NEED them to know you. The feeling of need can feel as strongly physical as hunger.
&gt; 
&gt; You think about them all the time, you imagine what you would be like together, you're always anticipating the next time you get to see or talk to them.
&gt; 
&gt; And this is all, like, when you're first developing a crush and first dating. When you've been with someone for a long time, the intensity levels of these feelings change.
&gt; 
&gt; And also this isn't to say that platonic feelings can't be as strong. They're just different. It's like hunger and thirst. You don't crave a hamburger when you're thirsty and you don't crave a glass of water when you're hungry. They're two different levels. Comparable, but undeniably unique.

* &gt; For me, initial romantic attraction to someone I don't know very well yet feels mostly like being really, really excited about being friends with them. Honestly sometimes that makes it hard for me to recognize when something is romantic attraction vs., like, friendship attraction? But it does have a certain intensity to it that sets it apart from the normal feeling of "wow this person seems nice, I'd like to get to know them better." I find that I'm thinking about them all the time, there is often frequent Facebook stalking involved haha, seeing them totally brightens my day and if I have plans with them it's the biggest thing I'm looking forward to. All of these things are things that might happen with someone I wanted to become better friends with, too, but with someone I'm romantically attracted to it's just.....more. It's almost compulsive, like I couldn't stop thinking about them even if I wanted to.
&gt; 
&gt; When I develop romantic feelings for someone I already know and love, on the other hand, it's a much more profound yet relaxed sort of warmth deep inside me. Romantic feelings are very tied up in a sense of domesticity for me – when I developed romantic feelings for a long-distance friend, I desperately wanted us to live together, because I wanted him to be the person I came home to and caught up with about my day over dinner; and when he came to visit, all I wanted was for us to cook meals together, hang out in our pyjamas, that sort of thing. When I developed romantic feelings for a friend I already lived with, the romantic feelings were still very tied up in the domesticity of our friendship: everything from cooking to cleaning to doing laundry to eating dinner has developed from something that we're each doing separately but cooperatively to something that has a certain sense of togetherness. (I could go into more detail but I feel like this is already getting long!) There is also an element of physical intimacy for me as well – I tend to be very physically affectionate even with friends in whom I don't have romantic interest, lots of hugs etc., but when there's romantic feelings involved there's a desire for more intimate forms of physical affection (usually cuddling in bed) and it's also a much stronger desire that I think about much more frequently than with typical friendships. If something small reminds me of that person at a random moment during the day, I'll just sort of smile to myself and think, "I love them so much" – which, again, is something that might happen with a non-romantic friendship that I felt very strongly emotionally invested in, but probably not with the same frequency nor with the same weightiness to the sense of love.

* &gt; I think it's also important to point out that you can even feel romantic attraction for total strangers. Like if someone cute smiles at me in a store sometimes I get that warm, fuzzy feeling and start thinking about what our lives would be like together (cute things we'd do together, getting married, raising kids, etc.). Whereas when I experience platonic attraction for a stranger, it's more of a feeling of "Wow, they look like a cool person, I'd really like to hang out with/get to know them. I bet we'd be great friends."

* &gt; [In response to love being described as an illness] I think quotes like that are talking about having feelings for someone that you're not with.
&gt; 
&gt; The longing can feel very painful, and you'd think you'd want that to stop, but you don't. If anything, you do things that make the feeling stronger.
&gt; 
&gt; You don't want it to stop because you're longing for something that feels so good (being with that person), so even though it's painful (because you're not with them), the thought of getting what you desire fuels the pain.
&gt; 
&gt; So it's comparable to being sick, but only with the unspoken (but understood) caveat that you may eventually benefit from the illness. Imagine if every time you were sick, you got something you REALLY wanted (money, for example.)
&gt; 
&gt; Now if you know that you will never be with the person, the feeling gets much more painful, and at this point you do want it to stop. Like you got sick with the idea that you'd get a million dollars at the end, but then you found out you won't get the money, even though you're already sick. Now you would want the sickness to stop.

### Sensual and aesthetic attraction

* &gt; I guess it could be described as a sort of longing to touch someone and be close to them. Wondering how warm and soft their cuddles would be. The pleasant sound of their voice is when you speak with them. How soft their lips or cheek may be if you were to surprise them with a peck. Imagining playing with their hair as they lay down on your lap. The safe feeling of having your hand held by theirs or them sharing their body warmth during winter. Giving them a massage when they're all tense and being happy to keep it at that.
&gt; 
&gt; That's what I could think of off the top of my head xD. I think it's easier to describe it using examples of physical closeness.

* &gt; I'd never really thought about it much before, but I'm not sure I actually feel sensual *attraction* per se. I crave physical closeness and intimacy, I find myself fantasizing about how nice it would be to curl up on a couch with someone I trust completely snuggled close as we watch a movie together, but I don't think I ever really see someone and think "I want to touch/cuddle with/hug that person."
&gt; 
&gt; I want to do those things with someone, but it's more of an abstract feeling than an attraction targeted at specific people. I think the closest I've come is sort of a general curiosity about what it would feel like to hug/cuddle with/touch different people of different shapes and sizes.

* &gt; For me, it's directly related to wanting to touch their skin, and feel the warmth and smoothness of it, not just wanting to feel their warmth through their clothes. While it was used to talk about sexual attraction, the line, "There is literally no feeling in the world for me like feminine skin" resonates with me for sensual attraction. It's also that I just want to give them a big hug and never let go. And instead of describing it as the safety of holding their hand, it's more of a calm serenity for me, but that's just splitting hairs.

* &gt; I personally definitely have sensual attraction towards my BFF. For example hearing: every time I hear his voice I can't help but smile and life just feels a bit better and safer. Smell: The smell of him, and/or I guess of his house, also gives my feelings of cozy and safe because it is associated with him.

* &gt; For me is a sensual act e.g. if you are sitting with a friend on a nice evening, with a pot of tea, and you play collaborative games. Perhaps this sounds stupid, but for me, this can be a very sensual act because you try to combine your minds, your thoughts, your intuition, to reach a common goal. So this is not based on some sensory organ, but on thoughts and feelings.

* &gt; When I’m attracted to somebody i feel a really strong, specific desire to have my face pressed up against theirs, to smell their warm skin, hear their breath, feel their scruff against me, and the way their clothes feel on my skin. it’s like their fully-clothed person is an experience. that’s the height of physical intimacy in my mind i guess.

* &gt; For context, hetero(maybe bi, idk)romantic grey cis male.
&gt; 
&gt; In my experience, sensual attraction is the maximum amount of attraction I could have towards someone 99 times out of 100. I basically want to be physically closer to them than is technically possible, while still feeling no desire for actual sex unless it's an extremely special case (hence the greyness). But trying to speak more generally... it's looking at someone and wanting to get lost in their presence. To feel their body close to your own, to squeeze them tight. To kiss their cheek, their neck, their lips... to shiver at their touch and fluster at their sigh. To feel them laying on your lap, your foreheads pressed to one another, grinning softly with the occasional kiss as you hold each others hands tight. To have that be as far as it goes, and to want that moment to last forever.

* &gt; I crave physical contact with another person. I guess it's different for everyone, but for me it's about that contact happening with everyone's clothes on, and with it not being a prelude to sex or anything closely related to sex. So, cuddling, hugging, sitting closely.
&gt; 
&gt; An intense feeling of wanting to hug someone, is how I generally know. It's not always linked to romance, either.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess by asking yourself if you feel like you want to hug or cuddle with another person? There's probably other sensual acts that people enjoy, i would look at what those are and work out whether you feel attracted to do those with someone.
&gt; 
&gt; But, it's different for everyone. Hope that all helped.

* &gt; I have a ton of Sensual attraction (29M Demi) I love cuddling, holding hands, hugging, any way to get skin on skin contact. It's also entirely non sexual for me, although I know I have to be careful because I know it is for some people. I also don't need to have Romantic attraction in order to have Sensual attraction, but if I am Romantically attracted to someone I will have even more Sensual attraction.

### Platonic and alterous attraction

* &gt; I experience platonic/alterous attraction. I kinda use the terms interchangeably, but I know some other people differentiate between them. To me, platonic/alterous attraction means wanting to be around someone, to talk to them, to get to know them, to be emotionally intimate with them, and to feel totally comfortable around them.
&gt; 
&gt; It can make me feel giddy, exited, or happy. I'm often sensually attracted to the people I'm platonically/alterously attracted to, so often I want to be physically close to them or cuddle with them without it being romantic or sexual. I like some of the same things that people often consider to be romantic gestures (holding hands, telling people how much they mean to me, etc.), but the thought of them being interpreted as romantic gestures makes me uncomfortable.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to have one or more platonic partners—people I feel totally comfortable around and consider to be family. To me, the label I use to describe the relationship isn't really important. I have good friends, but I've never had something like a QPR with anybody. A combination of autism and social anxiety makes it hard for me to open up to people.
&gt; 
&gt; It was a really liberating feeling to learn about platonic/alterous attraction. Until I came out as aro/ace, I had always felt somewhat broken because I didn't experience sexual/romantic attraction like my peers. Realizing that there are different forms of attraction was really helpful for understanding and accepting myself, and realizing that I had options beyond a romantic, heterosexual, monogamous relationship made me a lot more hopeful for the future.

* &gt; With platonic relationships I'm just excited to spend time with them and enjoying talking to them, it makes me happy whenever I see them and every platonic friendship is special in a way.
&gt; 
&gt; But then I have some friends where it's the same but stronger. Alterous attraction fits pretty well. I crave their attention and just want them to be a part of my life, all the time. It's borderline romantic but romantic never felt like the right term for it. I've often felt an aesthetic attraction to those friends as well, but not sexual attraction.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not in a QPR rn but I would like to be. When I think about a future relationship with an SO, it looks like a QPR

* &gt; Platonic relationships become very important to me, which is why I form so few of them. For most of my life, my wants to form platonic relationships were the only aspect I was certain about. Figuring out my romantic and sexual orientation was difficult, but I never faltered when it came to the friendships and familial relationships I formed. I haven’t figured out how it relates to romance yet.
&gt; 
&gt; As cliche as it sounds, but for the people I grow to platonically like and even love, I feel a warm sensation for each person in my heart (it’s different with each person though). I have synesthesia, so I “feel” colors for everyone I meet and it’s like a fingerprint. Each “feeling” of color is different for each person.
&gt; 
&gt; I always had a feeling my platonic relationships were going to last me a long time. It’s the only type of relationship I was always certain about.

## Life events

###Discovering you're asexual

* &gt; I first figured it out through TV Tropes. I saw the term "Asexual" going through a page there and when I tried learning more about it, everything just sort of clicked.

* &gt; I knew about asexuality since a very early age, a character from a teens show from my country was one, but I was young so I didn't paid a lot of attention, I also think they must have pretty much only scrape the surface of it.
&gt; 
&gt; All I knew is that Asexuality = not wanting anything sexual. I thought I couldn't be because I like to fantasize and masturbate and watch porn/read smut and as I grew I just assume that my social anxieties were the reason why actual physical intimacy with another didn't seem attractive to me. And I actually made peace with that.
&gt; 
&gt; Over a year ago I found the term demisexuality in a fanfic and I read a bit about it and started toying with the idea I could be. Most of my fantasies were/are about fictional characters that I really liked so I thought maybe that was a bit demi, I felt attracted to people (fake ones) that I had a connection with and simply haven't met someone like that IRL.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea of demi stayed in my mind for almost a year but I didn't did a deep dive until I had a conversation with a person that made me want to be able to take a stand about myself and I to realize I couldn't because I wasn't sure. So I started to do actual research and realize I wasn't demi but must have been in the ace spectrum though I would still not call myself ace until I created this account here to plainly ask what people here thought of me, and people had the answer. Anegosexuality (or, as was told me, Aegosexuality). I read and everything clicked and I could easily call myself ace after that.

* &gt; I saw the word written in an lgbt forum, and I was like “oh. I don’t really want to have sex. ever.” I hadn’t given sex much thought before, I just sort of thought of it as something I didn’t need to worry about and therefore didn’t ever wonder about it.

* &gt; Knew I was different ever since I started puberty. Everyone told me "you'll like boys when you're older!" or "just wait, you'll find the right guy, then you'll know what the fuss is about." But it never happened. I believed for a while, but the older I got the weirder I felt because my feelings about men (and women, for that matter) never changed.
&gt; 
&gt; It all clicked that I was asexual after a particularly funny misunderstanding with some coworkers during a conversation about Justice League (they said they liked Aquaman, I mentioned I didn't really, then one aske "so what kind of guys are you're type?" Confusion ensued). I did some research and found AVEN, read about asexuality and realized it described me perfectly.

* &gt; When I got into high school was probably when I started realizing there was something different about me, for a while I ascribed it to being sheltered as a kid and being a late bloomer but as time went on I had an inkling that maybe it wasn't that. I was maybe 15 or 16 when I first heard the word asexuality and it kinda struck a chord with me, though like many I assumed it also meant a lack of romantic attraction (I am a hopeless romantic) so I kinda brushed it off. It was when I started watching BoJack Horseman, with its portrayal of an ace character, did I decide to look into it further. I found AVEN and this sub and started to really dig into it and it all just made sense, like so many things in my life made sense all of a sudden. 

### Coming out

* &gt; When I came out, it was completely by accident. I was about 15. I was doing dishes with my Mom. Dad and my little brothers were in the living room right next to the kitchen. Somehow the topic of relationships came up and after they talked to each other about it they suddenly directed the conversation to me, I think they asked me what kind of girls I'm into or something. Without even thinking, I blurted out "Oh, I wouldn't know anything about that. I'm asexual". It was embarrassing.
&gt; 
&gt; Luckily, I didn't get kicked out for not being straight or anything like you would usually hear. Most I dealt with was Dad and my little brothers making fun of me for two to three years for being asexual. Which I was already the butt of their jokes long before that so I was already used to shit like that.

* &gt; I just casually posted on insta. I didn't feel the need to make a big deal about it personally, so that worked pretty perfectly for me. Plus, my dad (slightly homophobic, not sure how he'd take it) isn't on there so I didn't have to come out to him. As for feeling differently afterwards, I just kinda felt like ppl knew a little bit more about me, which was cool. 

* &gt; The first time I came out, it was to a bunch of my long-time online friends, and I had a very positive response. After that, it was my parents, who were mostly okay with it, and then my more liberal friends, and now it’s pretty much any time it comes up. Most of the responses have been indifferent or positive

* &gt; When I finally figured everything out (before I started questioning things again), I, personally, felt super guilty not telling my family. At the same time though, I was terrified to tell any of them. (Even though I later found out that my mom is bi.)
&gt; 
&gt; When I finally mustered up the courage to finally tell my mom, relief began to flow through me, which continued as she took care of telling others for me since I was still terrified to tell others.
&gt; 
This is different for everyone, but this is how I was. So yes, it did help me, but it was also on my mind a lot where the only time I didn't really think about it was at school. It's ultimately for you to come out. If you don't want to or feel the need to, then you don't have to.

* &gt; Yes, my parents especially were accepting of me. They had never put any pressure on me before, so their reaction was mostly, “So that’s why. That’s cool.”

* &gt; I’ve been lucky. Everyone has been really great about it, once they knew what it was.

* &gt; All around it was a really great experience. I cried from happiness because it felt like a weight had lifted off my chest.

* &gt; I felt a lot of relief, also my mom was really worried that I wasn't happy so explaining that I'm ace (aroace) helped her realize I was just fine where I was.

**Negative coming out experiences**

* &gt; Most people disbelived me and even asked numerous questions to try and find the reason behing my unwillingness to fuck. A lot of them suggested therapy and treated me as a labrat that is now open to scrutiny and can be used to prove or refute their own personal theories.

* &gt; My cousin said some very hurtful things to me and I was very depressed, even suicidal for a while. I had to cut him out of my life. If people can’t accept you for who you are, then they don’t deserve your time of day.

* &gt; My mother was furious. I explained what asexuality was, but she was adamant it didn’t exist. “There’s only heterosexuality and homosexuality!” she shouted. I didn’t make matters better when I confessed to being bi-romantic. After threatening to hit me, she stormed out of my room. (I should note that she did not hit me, only threatened to.) Later when my dad came upstairs to wish me goodnight I came out to him too. He didn’t care so much about the bi-romantic part. But when I told him I was asexual- I’ve never seen him look so disappointed. He wasn’t angry, just sad almost. Like I’d failed him. He told me that I was still young, and not to make such a big decision just yet. Both my parents act like that night never happened.

**Reasons for/against coming out**

* &gt; I came out to a small group of people (a mix of close family and friends) because I didn’t want to keep a part of myself I considered important completely to myself, and I think it’s important to be honest with those closest to you.

* &gt; I told other people because I couldn’t keep it to myself any longer. I felt like the longer I kept it a secret, the more ashamed of it I would become, and I didn’t want to be ashamed of my sexuality.

* &gt; I want young aces to know they’re not alone. I felt so isolated through much of my adolescence, and I think that if I had known of one other ace, I wouldn’t have felt as confused and alone as I did. So I want to be that one other ace for young people.

* &gt; My asexuality is not something I make a big deal out of, and I don’t really feel the need to tell people unless they specifically ask whether I’m ace.

* &gt; I only come out if it is necessary and would not voluntarily do so to anyone I didn’t know well, as I don’t see how my orientation is most people’s business.

## Relationships

### Ace–ace relationships

* &gt; I’m in an ace-ace relationship, and I really didn’t consider it rare. My fiancé is ace, but is a lot more soft-spoken about it than I am.
&gt; 
&gt; Our relationship leans heavily toward romantic. I know she has identified as demisexual in the past, and I know I’m on the asexual spectrum, but I’m still questioning a lot of things. Our relationship works well on the simple basis that we both love each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Our relationship only really differs in one way from other couples, and you probably can guess what that is. We both have a particularly low sex drive, which is I think another thing that works in our favor as an ace-ace couple. I’ve known couples (not all, maybe not even the majority) that focus on sex, but for us it’s almost the opposite. Our relationship relies more heavily on romance / simply being there for one another.

* &gt; I am currently in an ace-ace relationship and it is the best relationship I have ever been in!
&gt; 
&gt; I did not know I was an ace until I met my boyfriend. He came out to me pretty early in our relationship and I learned more about asexuality and realized I am an ace too.
&gt; 
&gt; The hardest part is that both him and I have been in serious relationships with non-aces. We would sacrifice our "ace-self" and try to physically satisfy our partner. When we started dating, we fell into this same habit. Neither of us enjoyed the physical affection we were showing (making out), but we did it out of perceived social norms and previous expectations. After we talked about how we felt, everything has been better. We can both express when we want more than cuddles or holding hands, if we are feeling that inclination, or we can stop whatever we are doing and simply be together. It is refreshing and we have complete trust in one another and we are comfortable in our intimacy.
&gt; 
&gt; Another challenging part is our parents' views. His parents and my parents do not understand what it means to be an ace. Even after explaining it in several ways, they question whether or not it is real. Also, my older siblings do not know what it means to be asexual. Although they all are accepting, they do not know how to best support us. My mom told me, "sex is a critical part of a relationship and you need it to be frequent." Both my boyfriend and I laughed at that statement because everyone knows we love each other, yet we have never had sex nor had the desire to.
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, we are planning having our own family some day. He told me that if we want to have our own kids, that is fine, but he also said that if I would rather adopt, that is just as good in his eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the most important thing is finding someone who supports you fully and who you support fully. Whether you are both aces or not, making sure you take time to understand one another is critical.


* &gt; I guess an ace-ace relationship is pretty rare, then factoring in if our personalities are compatible is another important ingredient.
&gt; 
&gt; An ace-ace relationship, as *hopefully* my first ever relationship/commitment, would be the ideal. I just can't and won't ever want to deal with the sexual needs of a straight guy--no matter how nice of a person he is. I just can't deal with straight people ignoring my asexuality.
&gt; 
&gt; Ace-ace relationships probably aren't talked very much because of quantity reasons. Or maybe, it's an ace thing to keep things lowkey but sincere? :)

* &gt; I’ve been in an ace-ace relationship for almost 13 years. We had no idea for over half of that. It is pretty awesome as a couple but dealing with everyone else sucks.
&gt; 
&gt; Compared to my other relationships, it was extremely different. The first was just weird and short lived. I knew he was sleeping with one of my classmates, I didn’t really care because it was obvious that he was using me to make his mom happy (she adored me because I was such a “good” girl). The second one lasted a year. He broke up with me because he felt like our relationship was more like a strong friendship. The third was abusive. It was really bad, I have PTSD from it.
&gt; 
&gt; The biggest difference is that an ace-ace relationship is more relaxed. What one boyfriend considered a sign of friendship was very intimate for me. Without ever having to explain that my husband.
&gt; 
&gt; Most evenings are watching tv or playing video games while cuddling. Years ago our dates were to the zoo, volunteer events, and conventions.
&gt; 
&gt; We should have realized we were ace when I moved in with him and we had our separate spaces. Everyone would go on about why we would deny having sex, since people dating while cohabiting equates to sex. Our families pried into our sex lives a lot over the years. It is really frustrating.
&gt; 
&gt; No matter what, when it comes to a relationship, it results in having to deal with allos and their weird prying conversations.
&gt; 
&gt; Some interesting things about our relationship and family:
&gt; 
&gt; My husband is very heteroromantic and I go through bouts of almost being aromatic. Some of that is more my sensory issues. I don’t like being touched in certain ways (tickling makes me panic and cry, gentle touch and stroking makes me extremely uncomfortable).
&gt; 
&gt; We have three kids. The eldest is inching toward puberty. It is going to be interesting to see how that pans out. A lot of sexual things are off our radar. If they end up being allo, the teen years are going to be interesting.

* &gt; I think my mother's friends is in an ace/aro relationship. They're "companions" not just "friends who live with each other" and neither are dating anyone. I've never asked them personally about it though so only second hand info. I think that's a very ideal relationship for me.
&gt; 
&gt; my sister relationship with my twin might be that already since we may continue live with each other throughout adulthood (both ace/aro). I've always been closest with family and I guess that's what ace/aro relationships are like anyway.

* &gt; I think probably the biggest difference in all-ace versus mixed relationships is understanding body language. Sort of the same as for neurodivergent relationships; the nonverbal cues are different. Something that might be sexual to an allo person might not ping my radar very much.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I tend to be biased towards ace-ace relationships just because they read my flirting better.
&gt; 
&gt; Last fall, I got out of a fairly serious for its length year and a half long relationship with a demiromantic ace. We were on the same page with regards to sex, which probably wouldn’t have interested either of us very much at all if not for kink. Even though I wasn’t sexually attracted to them, they had similar tastes, so it became fun.

* &gt; A little late, but I’m in an ace-ace relationship!
&gt; 
&gt; Ive only dated one other person, who was a strong Allo. But that was in middle school. The only way I know he’s a strong allo is because I still kinda talk to him.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, if I had to compare, the ace-ace is so, so much better. We both know exactly what the other means, and we help each other through everything. We both understand that we have boundaries, and we clarified them too.
&gt; 
&gt; We’re very romantic, and our similarities and differences tend to balance us out as a couple, and we tend to be able to communicate silently through looks. We just have that strong mental bond and connection.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s honestly incredibly healing to be in an Ace-Ace relationship. As I’ve heard before, allo-Ace relationships you have to deal with figuring out what they’ll do when it comes to uh.. that. I’m a very repulsed ace, so I’m glad I don’t really have to have that type of conversation.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, we’re about to hit a year together, so I’m excited!

### Ace–allo relationships

'Ace–allo relationship' is a term that describes a romantic or alterous relationship between an asexual and a non-asexual.

* &gt; I am not asexual, but my husband is. he is one of those that doesn’t mind having sex, and has fun with it when i ask, but he never asks/initiates and I’m ok with that. Frankly I’d be ok if he never wanted to do it. while i enjoy sex, it’s not the end all be all of a relationship. we don’t often, but that’s mostly a me thing. he assured me that i can ask whenever, but he won’t bring it up himself because he just doesn’t think of it, but i still feel like I’m being pushy sometimes when i ask lol. i’ve been with him for five years though and i plan to be with him the rest of my life. it’s not an issue for me.

* &gt; I'm in an ace/allo relationship. My husband and I have been together for ~9 years now, married for ~3. I just found out a couple of months ago that I was ace. I was honestly terrified. I didn't know what it might mean for us. It became apparent when I came out to my husband, that sex was something that was very important for him in our relationship. I don't know if we could make it work if I was sex-repulsed, and I haven't asked because honestly I don't really want to know the answer to that question.
&gt; 
&gt; To really make things work, we have been very open about communication. What he needs to feel loved, and what I need. I'm super monogamous for the most part, so an open relationship is just not something I'm at all comfortable with. We talk a lot about things, sometimes more than we need to, but it's honestly helped. I try to keep a mental note (or an actual one) to initiate every so often (as he needs that I guess). I don't mind doing it, and I enjoy making him happy, but it can definitely all feel a bit silly at times. Honestly I've definitely felt better about things since coming out and accepting myself. I'm a lot more relaxed, and I feel less pressure when being intimate with my husband, because I know it's ok I don't feel the same way he does.

## Grey-asexuality and other identities

### Aegosexuality and aegoromanticism

* &gt; I'm female, 32 and I think I'm aego. I can and enjoy sexual fantasies, but hate including myself in them. Sometimes I try to, but if I'm honest, I don't think the person I'm imagining actually looks like me. Maybe how I wish I looked, lol. Mostly I picture characters from movies or TV shows in place of me. I actually don't generally fantasize about ANYONE I know.

* &gt; So, I'll start off by saying I'm a fangirl. I have a lot of favorite characters and ships that I like. I read fanfiction about them. I have a decent libido so, more often than not, the fanfiction I read have some sexual aspect to them. I like reading about and imagining my ships doing things in relationships (if they weren't already dating) and that often includes smut. I'm totally okay with smut and I do enjoy reading it. But that's only if the characters are doing things to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; xReader and self-insert fics are a whole different story. When the main character is me and the character(s) are being intimate and doing sexual things to me, that's when I get uncomfortable. I don't know why, really, but I don't like imagining or thinking of myself doing sexual things with my ships or favorite characters. Even if I have a crush on the character, I never want to have sex with them. I'll read about or watch them having sex with somebody else, maybe their s/o or someone I ship them with, but I don't want to be involved in it personally.
&gt; 
&gt; I can watch porn and I do sometimes, but only if it's not interactive and the pornstar isn't trying to make the experience more 'real' and immersing the viewer by talking to 'me' or something. Honestly, I don't really know how interactive porn works because I've never been interested enough to watch it, but I do know I won't be able to get turned on from it. Normal porn is fine for me, though. It's kind of interesting. The thing about me is I don't want to be personally involved in the act but, when I watch porn, I imagine how the bottom feels. Not the attraction part, because I honestly can't imagine how attraction must feel, but rather the physical pleasure part. I don't imagine myself in their place, I just imagine how they feel and that's what gets me off because I don't want to have sex with someone because I'm attracted to the person, I want to have sex with someone because I want to feel good.
&gt; 
It extends to my sexual fantasies, too. I have had exactly two sexual fantasies that included me and I can't clearly envision the faces in either of them. The first one isn't even inherently sexual, but in it, I can't see my own face or his. It's like I'm imagining the concept of me doing that to the concept of him. It's not really us, but it's meant to be us. Like, have you ever had a dream where there was a person you knew, but when you woke up, you realized it didn't look like that person at all, your brain just told you it was that person and you just accepted it? That's the best way I can explain it.
&gt; 
&gt; My second sexual fantasy ever involves a person that I don't have a solid idea of at all. They're not somebody I know, or somebody I've seen or met before. I don't see their face or know their name, I only know what they're doing. They don't exist, they're just someone my brain made up because while I'm fine with sexual acts, I don't want to do it with a person.
&gt; 

* &gt; I'm a 27 year old cis-female and I identify as an aegosexual and an aegoromantic. I enjoy porn,masturbation, and to a lesser extent, erotica. What I read and watch is very far removed from myself and is nothing I would ever be interested in trying. If I read a romance with a heterosexual sex scene, I have to skip it because it hits too close to home and makes me uncomfortable. When I was in my teens, fan fiction and erotica turned me on, but now it is quite rare for erotica to turn me on (maybe every few months?). Haven't read fan fiction since my teens.
&gt; 

* &gt; In a sense, being aegosexual (or anegosexual in case somebody wonders if it's different) is more relevant to me than being asexual is because it plays such a large part in governing my (very vivid) imagination. That, in turn, governs what I like to read.
&gt; 
&gt; I would never be able to imagine myself in a sexual situation (deep kissing, breast touching, penetration). I'm female, and, in fact, I can never imagine any female in a sexual situation, so, for example, I cannot project myself into an imaginary scene by pretending to be some other woman. That's just too close to home. By default, the people who populate the scenes of my imagination are therefore always men, and the sexual activity is always gay. (I can't apologise if that sound very binary. That's how it is.) I am in no way involved in participating. That is, I don't assume any of the roles. I'm just the creator of the imaginary scene. I don't get off on it; I'm not voyeuristic.
&gt; 

* &gt; Being aegoromantic means I do feel those empathic fluttery feelings when others fall in love. I love ships! Fictional, lyrical, celebrity, real-life: romance is fun, just hearing about it. I don't always understand it and wish we didn't center it in society. I think there's a lot we miss about romantic love and ignore other forms. But I do love romance as long as I'm not involved! (&lt;-- the definition of being aegoromantic)

### Cupiosexuality and cupioromanticism

Cupiosexuality refers to people that are asexual but also desire a sexual relationship. Cupioromanticism is the same concept but applied to aromanticism and romantic relationships.

* &gt; The first time I ever saw the word was in regards to this sub. I had to Google what it meant--but now I'm glad I did, because it's a term that fits me better than most others. I think cupio was coined because a lot of ace/aro circles are anti- or repulsed by the concepts of intercourse and romantic love respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; Cupio is not that. Far from disgust, it is possible to idealize or take interest in that which you do not experience. Since cupioromance seems to be the main focus of your question, I will elaborate in that direction.
&gt; 
&gt; Media and film glorify the idea of falling in love. The hunt for a mate is a driving force in a lot of people's lives. For confirmation of this, we can look at services responding to popular demand: I can name five huge dating websites off the top of my head, but besides meetup (which is still also used for singles meets), I cannot think of a single other big name service devoted to developing friendships.
&gt; 
&gt; For someone who does not have a romantic drive, this can be curious, alienating, even upsetting. To me, cupioromantism is the desire to understand and participate in what would seem to be a prominent aspect of human experience. But without a clear emotional understanding of romance and infatuation, the quest for understanding must often be undertaken in a more intellectual or investigative way.
&gt; 
&gt; One major hurdle to understanding, in my estimation, is the very media that sparks curiosity in the first place. Too often depictions of love, romance, and relationships in film and print are wildly unrealistic, thus adding to confusion.
&gt; 
&gt; Cupio may be a temporary state for some, a lifelong struggle for others. Ultimately, it is defined by a desire to understand or participate.

* &gt; Cupiosexuality is basically wanting sex without the attraftion. That's me.
&gt; 
&gt; Cupioromanticism is wanting to be romantic with someone (kissing and stuff) without the attraction.
&gt; 
&gt; I should explain cupiosexuality because that's a first hand perspective, and to apply to cupioromanticism, simply swap sexual things with romantic things.
&gt; 
&gt; Cupiosexuality to me is wanting sex. I want to basically be allo-- since I'm pancupio, I want to be pansexual. I want to have attraction and I want to have sex, but since I don't have attraction it confuses me how people get themselves into sexual situations.

## Feelings

### Arousal

* &gt; Oh boy, that's a difficult question. I guess it's different for others but for me it's just... the urge to like touch myself or be touched by someone else? My body's telling me that that's what it wants and even though I can just choose to ignore it I sure like to follow that request. It's really something I don't only feel like you feel emotions but also like you feel something your body tells you it wants. It's a mix of both for me and I'm guessing for most other allos too.

* &gt; For me it's akin to a full body high while being completely sober. Everything is a little bit more tingly, you're a bit more aware of each sensation and touch, and you're hyper aware of wanting to be touched and do touching. It's warm and feels kind of like a cocoon or bubble is encasing you and/or the person you're with. At least to me.

* &gt; Arousal for me is mostly an emotion, I guess? It feels like a warmth all over my body and my heart beats a little faster, but I always know I’m aroused when I’m aroused, if that makes sense. There is some focus on the lower region with that warmth, but I guess it’s a combination of sensation and emotion.

* &gt; My lower stomach gets hot and squirmy, sorta butterflies-y. My genitals get warm and feel very sensitive and swollen. I get wet. And also the emotional/mental feelings.

### Squishes

* &gt; For me, a squish is an aesthetic+personality attraction that I do NOT want reciprocated. I would describe a crush is an aesthetic+romantic attraction that I would hope is reciprocated because I would want it to develop into a romantic relationship.

* &gt; Squish: I want to look at you, sit with you, stay up 'til 2am exchanging bad puns with you.
&gt;  
&gt; Crush: I want to hold your hand.

* &gt; It's really, really easy for me to experience squish feelings, instantly freak out, and jump right to "omg, I have a crush on them, what do I do, am I not acearo anymore what happened who am I" and that is incredibly frustrating.
&gt; 
&gt; I have this thing that I do whenever I need to differentiate between a squish and a crush. I first picture the person in my mind as best I can and then picture kissing them and doing...other things. I usually don't get to the other things before being completely disgusted and overwhelmed, which reaffirms that I do not have a crush on them. I think that's the difference: do I want to have a physical, romantic relationship with them? If not, it's a squish and I just enjoy hanging out with them.
&gt; 
&gt; The people I've had squishes on are people I really enjoy hanging out with. I kind of look up to them too, for the most part. They've all been extremely smart people that know a lot about subjects I'm not particularly well-versed in, so we get to swap knowledge.

* &gt; The way I see it, a squish is when you want to spend time with a person and get to know them better. A crush is when you want the person themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; With romance, there's usually an expectation of exclusivity. A sense of "I belong to you, and you belong to me." This is why cheating on your spouse is deeply emotionally painful in a way that having multiple close friends is not. It's a different kind of love.
&gt; 
&gt; Even having a crush on someone you're not dating will usually come with feelings of jealousy if they're interested in someone else. This doesn't happen with squishes.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted, I'm aro-ace, so I don't really get crushes. But this is how I understand it.

* &gt; For me personally, when I have crushes my heart does this little squeeze when I see them or hear their name (if I’m spending a prolonged period of time with them then this usually only applies to when I first see them but it can also happen throughout depending). I’m still pretty anxious/emotionally underdeveloped so whenever this happens it means that I avoid eye contact and go to lengths to be nonchalant. I also think about them a lot and have a little trouble stopping, and I might randomly smile at the thought of them. I also get nervous before I say their name because a part of me is scared my voice will come out giddy if I do.
&gt; 
&gt; Squishes don’t really have those elements. There are some elements that are common to both squishes and crushes (planning my day/week to be around them more, wanting to text them a lot, doing whatever I can to make them smile, etc.), but I can’t think of any traits that are unique to just squishes and not crushes, except that squishes are easier because I’m a little less nervous.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, jealousy is different. With squishes, I can be jealous when they spend time with other people, but it’s more of a wistful (man, I should have been there) sort of thing, whereas with crushes there’s a little more pain there. Like, I guess the difference is that I wouldn’t mind if someone I’m squishing on (is that a phrase) spends time with other people if I could also be included. But with crushes, being included isn’t enough—there’s a spiteful part of me I try to ignore that wants everyone else to go away forever lmao.
