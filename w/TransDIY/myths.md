A list of common myths surround transgender HRT. These should be properly cited, but the analysis is by community members here, not actual medical professionals, so be sure to verify everything yourself. Don't trust random people on the internet!

# Non-binary HRT myths

## You can't pick and choose the effects of HRT

You can, but it's tricky and it doesn't have much scientific or clinical backing.

For example:

- raloxifene can be used to block breast growth for trans-feminine NB people.

- T levels can be manipulated to control fat distribution as well, especially if you control your diet/exercise smartly.

- E gel and T gel can be used to get effects only in specific parts of your body without affecting blood levels too much.

The point is that it is possible, but you'll need to do a lot of research and probably experiment on yourself to figure it out.

# Trans-feminine HRT myths

Myths about TF HRT, also referred to as MtF HRT

## Progynova can't be taken sublingually.

It can. It's micronized and can be cleaved into pure estradiol directly and rapidly in the blood.

## Spironolactone reduces T production

Spiro blocks the effects of T that is produced, but it usually doesn't affect blood levels or decrease production. A blood test can't tell you whether Spiro is blocking T or not.

## Different forms of estradiol have the same potency

This is less of a myth and more of an assumption.

Different esters add more weight to the form of estradiol, for example, estradiol valerate only has about 75% as much estradiol as pure estradiol by weight. This means you need around 30% more (or 1.3x) as much to get the same dose, so 3mg of pure estradiol (or estradiol hemihydrate) is the same dose as 4mg of estradiol valerate.

Here is a table comparing different forms of estradiol. Look at the "Rel. E2" and "Rel. MW" columns. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Structural_properties_of_major_estradiol_esters

## Blood tests are objective proof of average levels

The key word here is **average** levels. Blood tests are objective proof of levels, but they only measure a moment in time, and sex hormones can fluctuate very rapidly.

You can still experience very significant androgenic effects even though a blood test showed very low testosterone levels. This is only likely to happen with an instable form of estradiol like sublingual/buccal or oral though (oral is stable, but has other issues suppressing T), not injections or patches.

Some practical signs of androgenic effects are:

- acne
- body odor
- faster facial/body hair growth
- oily skin and hair
- unstimulated erections like "morning wood"

These effects will increase as androgens increase (and aren't blocked). Cis women experience these too, so you have to look at them relatively. "morning wood" is a pretty good indicator that your T is too high if you aren't sure how much of the other effects you should have. If you consistently have "morning wood", then there's likely an issue with T suppression or blocking.

If you notice these symptoms despite a low T blood test, it could be that you happened to test during a dip in levels even though your average T was higher that day, maybe your T increases only at night. It's also possible that you have a high DHT level which also causes androgenic effects and is more difficult to block but won't show up on a testosterone blood test.

## Cycling losing and gaining weight is required for fat redistribution

Fat needs to be burned and fat needs to be stored, but this happens every day in between meals even if your weight stays the same from day to day. You burn fat for energy, then that energy is replaced by meals on that same day. If your testosterone is low enough (or blocked), then you'll store new fat in feminine places. Over time, you'll burn fat from masculine places and that energy will be replaced in feminine places instead, which is fat redistribution!

To increase fat redistribution, the best option is exercise not cycling weight. Even slow walking will make a big difference in fat burning for that day.

## Progesterone increases breast growth

There is no actual scientific evidence for this. It might even hinder breast growth if taken too early.

(as of early 2019) The only certain benefits of progesterone for transfeminine people are T suppression (especially when combined with estradiol) and neurosteroid effects like improved sleep.

## Oral progesterone increases blood levels significantly

Oral progesterone only really increases levels of allopregnanolone because of the first pass effect in the liver, so it has lots of mental effects like drowsiness and anti-anxiety for a short time after taking it, but it doesn't increase blood levels of progesterone by much.

Injections of progesterone work too, but you'd need to inject every single day to get steady levels. That leaves rectal progesterone as the only practical option for suppressing T production.
