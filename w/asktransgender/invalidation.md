# What is Invalidation?
Invalidation is to reject, ignore, mock, tease, judge, or diminish someone's feelings. It is an attempt to control how they feel and for how long they feel it.


# Examples of Invalidation#

**"Ordering" you to feel differently**

 * *Stop being so emotional.*
 * *Stop taking everything so personally.*

**Ordering you to "look" differently**

 * *Don't look so proud of yourself.*
 * *Don't make that face.*

**Denying your perception, Defending**

 * *That is ridiculous (nonsense, totally absurd, etc.)*
 * *I honestly don't judge you as much as you think.*

**Trying to make you feel guilty while invalidating you**
 
 * *I tried to help you...*
 * *You are making everyone else miserable.*

**Trying to isolate you**
 
 * *It doesn't bother anyone else, why should it bother you?*
 * *You are the only one who feels that way.*

**Minimizing your feelings**
 
 * *Your life can't be that bad.*
 * *You are just ... (being difficult; being dramatic, in a bad mood, tired, etc)*

**Using reason**
 
 * *But it doesn't make any sense to feel that way.*
 * *There is no reason to get upset.*

**Debating**
 
 * *I don't always do that.*
 * *It's not that bad. (that far, that heavy, that hot, that serious, etc.)*

**Judging and labeling you**
 
 * *You are over-reacting. You are too thin-skinned.*
 * *You are an insensitive jerk.*

**Turning things around**

 * *You are making a big deal out of nothing.*
 * *You are making a mountain out of a molehill.*

**Trying to get you to question yourself**

 * *What's wrong with you, can't you take a joke?*
 * *Do you really think that crying about it is going to help anything?*

**Telling you how you "should" feel or act**

 * *You should feel thankful that...* 
 * *You should feel ashamed of yourself.* 

**Defending the other person**

 * *Maybe they were just having a bad day.* 
 * *I am sure she didn't mean it like that.* 

**Negating, denial and confusion**

 * *You don't really mean that. You are just ... (in a bad mood today, tired, cranky)*
 * Now you know that isn't true.

**Sarcasm and mocking**

 * *Oh, you poor thing. Did I hurt your little feelings?*
 * *What happened to you? Did you get out of the wrong side of bed again?*

**Laying guilt trips**

 * *Have you ever stopped to consider my feelings?*
 * *Don't you ever think of anyone but yourself?* 

**Philosophizing or clich√©s**

 * *In time you will understand this.* 
 * *Every cloud has a silver lining.* 

**Talking about you when you can hear it**

 * *She is impossible to talk to.*
 * *You can't say anything to her.*

**Showing intolerance**

 * *This is getting really pathetic.*
 * *I am sick of hearing about it.*

**Trying to control how long you feel something, or judging you for how long you feel it**

 * *Are you still upset over that? It happened a long time ago.* 
 * *You should be over that by now.*

**Explanations**

 * *Maybe it is because...*
 * *Of course, because you.... (This one hurts four ways. First, the "of course" minimizes what you feel, second the "because" explains what you feel, as if explaining it nullifies the feeling, third the "you" blames you and fourth, blaming you is a form of attack which is likely to make you feel either defensive or guilt-tripped or both.)*
