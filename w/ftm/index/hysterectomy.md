## Should I get a hysterectomy as part of my transition?

There are several reasons why you might consider having a hysterectomy as part of your transition.

* You want the parts gone for your personal peace of mind.

* To eliminate the risk of health problems associated with reproductive organs (endometriosis, uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer). This may be especially relevant if you have a family history of these problems.

* Hysterectomy is required for a legal gender change in some regions.

* You're interested in the chance to lower your testosterone dose. Some people are able to lower their dose after removing the estrogen-producing ovaries, but certainly not all. Some people even need to increase their dose ([source](https://lgbtqpn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medical-Therapy-and-HM-for-Transgender-Men_2005.pdf), p. 53).

Risks and potential complications of hysterectomy surgery

* Adverse reactions to anesthesia (nausea, vomiting, rare congenital reactions)

* Infection of surgical site (abdomen)

* Infection of the bladder

* Vesicovaginal fistula, where a hole forms between the vagina and the bladder. The risk is only 1-2%, but see one trans mans experience [here](https://genderoutlaw.wordpress.com/2009/04/14/spontaneous-healing-of-vvf/). 

* Osteoporosis: The body requires some sort of sex hormone, either estrogen or testosterone, at all times to maintain bone density. If you remove your ovaries, you will have to take either testosterone or estrogen continually thereafter ([source](https://lgbtqpn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medical-Therapy-and-HM-for-Transgender-Men_2005.pdf), p. 61). If you plan to stop taking testosterone in the future, consider having a hysterectomy while keeping your ovaries.

* Energy and mood: The hormonal fluctuations that result from removing the ovaries may alter your mood, possibly long-term. This can include a loss of energy and/or sex drive.

## What are my options in choosing a hysterectomy?

You can discuss with your doctor exactly which parts you want removed as part of the hysterectomy: uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and cervix.  

* If you are not on testosterone or expect to discontinue it in the future, you may want to keep your ovaries in order to maintain bone density without testosterone. If you intend to have biological offspring after your hysterectomy and have not already preserved eggs, you will need to keep your ovaries.  

* If you retain your ovaries and stop taking testosterone, you may continue to experience effects of the hormonal cycle, although you won’t have menstrual periods.

* If you retain your cervix, you will need to have regular Pap tests as cancer screening. Depending on your sexual activity, it is recommended to have this test every 1-3 years ([source](https://lgbtqpn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medical-Therapy-and-HM-for-Transgender-Men_2005.pdf), p. 53).

* If you’re removing your ovaries, then the fallopian tubes will no longer serve any purpose, so it is probably best to remove them too. Cancer of the fallopian tubes is possible ([source](https://lgbtqpn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medical-Therapy-and-HM-for-Transgender-Men_2005.pdf), p. 53).

You also decide what method of surgery you want done. Not all surgeons offer all of these methods. If you’re looking at a specific surgeon, inquire with them about what methods are offered that would be appropriate for you. This summary is based on the [GIRES Guide to Lower Surgery for Trans Men](https://www.gires.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lower-surgery.pdf), p. 11-12.

* **Abdominal hysterectomy**: A long incision is made across the abdomen and everything is removed through this incision. This method usually requires a longer recovery time than the other methods. If you plan to have abdominal phalloplasty in the future, you may want to avoid this procedure because it results in a scar across the abdomen that would be transferred to the penis.

* **Laparoscopic hysterectomy**: Several small incisions (under 1 inch long) are made in the abdomen, and special instruments and a camera are inserted to carry out the surgery. The parts to be removed are cut up into small pieces and removed through the same incisions. A special type of laparoscopic procedure, the [Da Vinci method](http://www.davincisurgery.com/da-vinci-gynecology/conditions/uterine-fibroids/hysterectomy.php), uses robotic instruments instead of handheld. 

* **Vaginal hysterectomy**: The surgical instruments are inserted into the abdomen via the vaginal canal. The parts to be removed are passed through the vagina to remove them. This method may not be possible if the uterus is enlarged or the vaginal canal is narrow.

* **Laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH)**: This method uses a laparoscopic camera to help the surgeon see what they are doing during a vaginal hysterectomy.

## What is the recovery like for hysterectomy?

The authors of this FAQ are not medical professionals and the following is not medical advice. See our full [Medical Disclaimer](w/ftm/index#wiki_medical_disclaimer).

Hysterectomy is usually performed as an outpatient procedure, where you go home the same day. Some surgeons will have you stay in the hospital overnight for monitoring. To reduce the risk of postoperative complications, it is important to follow your surgeon’s directions and communicate with them if you have any questions or concerns. The hysterectomy procedure involves working in the abdominal cavity where many other organs reside, namely the bladder and intestines. The most common postoperative complications are to do with the bowel and bladder, or infection in the abdominal cavity. During your recovery it is important not to strain your body, and especially important not to use your abdominal muscles whenever possible. Refrain from lifting and prolonged standing. Use your arms to lift yourself out of bed instead of your abs. When returning to school or work, consider getting a rolling backpack so you don’t need to carry things.

Recovery is generally easier for the laparoscopic/vaginal procedure than for the abdominal procedure. With a laparoscopic or vaginal procedure you may take 4 weeks to get back to your normal activities, minus heavy exercise and lifting. For an abdominal procedure, it will be closer to 6-8 weeks.
