## How do I bind?
 
For binding a large chest, [Neutrois Nonsense](http://neutrois.me/2013/03/27/all-about-binding/) and [Goldengray](http://goldengray.tumblr.com/post/4260834534/help-binding-101-for-big-chests) have written guides.
 
/u/YoungFolks gives advice on binding, with emphasis added:
 
&gt; You've got several options, but let's go over prices first. Binders can run anywhere between $10-$100, average being about $30. Amazon and ebay have really cheap asian brands that are decent if you're skinnier and smaller chested (A or B, maybe C), but they don't last as long. The most recommended brand is Underworks, and they have several styles that are better for larger chests and torsos. They also have an awesome return and exchange policy. Then there are brands like t-kingdom, which are pretty good and have different styles, but can run a bit costly.
 
&gt; Now for styles. Most underworks binders are the pull on type. You just pull them on. Or step into them and pull them up, whatever works. Some binders come with hooks on the side, or velcro, that you can adjust to your size. Others come with a zipper.
 
&gt; **If you can't get a binder,** you can use a compressing sports bra, a compression tshirt, or a wrap around back brace. Never use an ace bandage, because they are designed to constrict over time, and can cause serious damage.
 
&gt; Sizing is very important. You want to compress the breasts, not your ribs. Make sure the binder doesn't hurt and you can breathe. It can be pretty easy to damage your ribs or internal organs with a too tight binder. Be very careful to **read the sizing info before you buy,** especially if you go for an asian brand (their sizing is different).
 
&gt; **Don't wear one longer than ~8 hours.** Don't exercise in one, because your lungs need room to expand when you work out. Don't sleep in one either. Binding for long amounts of time constantly will damage breast tissue, and make them saggier. T will also make breasts squishier, which can make binding easier.
 
&gt; **Tips for wearing.** Every person is different, and you're gonna have to figure out how to position your breasts to acheive the best look. Some people like them straight forward. Some pull them down, or up, and to the side. Play around and see what works for you. Use something like gold bond powder between the binder and your skin if you will be wearing it a long time or you're likely to sweat. It'll prevent chafing, keep you drier, and be more comfortable. If you're large breasted, getting a long binder and turning it up so it doubles over can give you a bit of extra power.
 
&gt; Don't wash your binder with the rest of your laundry. It'll deteriorate the binding ability. Usually you can **handwash in cold water and air dry.** You should also avoid swimming in one, because the chemicals in the water can also damage it. There are binders made specifically for swimming, or you can wear a rash gaurd.
 
&gt; Binders usually come in black or white, occasionally beige. White gets dirty or stained pretty easily, so buy with caution. Black might get really hot in summer. Some binders are short and look like bras, others look like tanks or tshirts.
 
&gt; **If buying online is an issue,** amazon has gift cards you can buy in stores and use to make purchases on their website, or you could get a prepaid credit card. That's a card you load up with money beforehand, and can use to buy things until you reach the limit you loaded up. Or you can have a friend order for you.

### Alternates to traditional binding

* Compression sports bras may be suitable for medium-to-small sized chests.  As with binders, wearing one that is too small may be dangerous.
* [Athletic compression shirts](http://www.undershirtguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/omsignal-biometric-smartwear-black-crew-neck-compression-shirt.jpg) can be effective for small chests or for when you don’t need to be perfectly flat. The higher the percentage of Spandex or Lycra, the better. 
* A [camisole](http://tomstoast.tumblr.com/post/71729865251/hey-there-frends-i-know-a-lot-of-you-out-there) can be used to bind. Probably won't work well for larger chests, but you can pick camisoles up for ~$4 at Walmart and other big box stores so they're a very cheap and relatively safe alternative. 
* [Puffy vests](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aCqu3u9gixY/UQXTqeBQb4I/AAAAAAAABa8/k4BGDzwwJAI/s400/lands-end-vest.jpg), baggy hoodies, and other clothing that fills space can disguise the chest.
* See [Passing and Presentation](w/ftm/index#wiki_passing_and_presentation) for tips on dressing to conceal your chest.

### Binding for swimming or exercising?

When you engage in physical activity, your body’s need for oxygen increases. Binding too tightly while exercising can restrict your breathing, depriving you of oxygen and causing a buildup of harmful carbon dioxide. Bind lightly when exercising, take breaks, and do not push yourself if you begin to feel dizzy or short of breath. If you work out at a gym or somewhere else public, it may be helpful to hang a towel over your shoulders; depending on the size of your chest, it may help mask a looser binding job.

It is recommended to bind using a sports bra or a binder that is one size too large when engaging in any strenuous physical activity such as exercising

For swimming, a rashguard or t-shirt over a binder works, but your binder may become damaged by water, especially in a chlorinated pool. [Underworks](http://www.f2mbinders.com/swimgear), [Flavnt](http://www.flavnt.com/bareskin/), and [Double T](http://www.lesloveboat.com/shop/index.php?cPath=93) make swim binders.

### KT Tape

[KT Tape Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/6ggdy8/kt_tape_megathread_june_reading_post_linked/)

Another safe alternative to using a binder is KT Tape, or kinesthetic tape, which is tape that is meant to be adhered to your skin to provide joint support to athletes. It comes in a roll of pre-cut strips for around $12, although there are generic brands that cost less. The primary benefit of binding with KT Tape is that it does not constrict your chest at all and can be left on for a few days at a time, so it's really comfortable and you can put it on and forget about it for a while. It is okay to swim or shower with.

[Here](http://get--pumped.tumblr.com/post/158446166718/seethestarsablaze-so-i-get-asked-all-the-time) (NSFW) is a visual guide on how it is applied, as well as some written instructions. The gist of how you use it is as follows:

* Cut the strips in half (so you have two shorter pieces) to conserve them.
* Cover your nipples with a bandaid, gauze, etc. to protect them.
* Place the leading edge of the tape on the front of your chest, near or over your nipple.
* Stretch everything back and to the side, under your armpit, and adhere the tape.
* Rub the tape to activate the adhesives. 
* You may need to use more than one strip to get flat enough.

It is most effective for people with smaller chests (C cup and smaller). The bigger your chest, the more tape you will need to use--but only to a certain point.

The primary complaint people have in terms of comfort with KT Tape is that the adhesives can irritate your skin, and it can be difficult to remove and take some skin with it. Here are some tips to help mitigate that:

* Soak the tape in oil (baby oil, olive oil, vegetable oil, etc) for about 10 minutes before removing. 
* Take the tape off in the shower, preferably after soaking with oil.
* The manufacturer recommends applying milk of magnesia to your skin before putting the tape on to minimize irritation.

## Is binding dangerous?

*The authors of this FAQ are not medical professionals and the following is not intended as medical advice.*

Binding can be dangerous, or it can be a lot safer, depending on how it’s done. This is because binding compresses the chest area where the lungs are located. The most dangerous and discouraged methods of binding are tape and elastic (or Ace) bandages. A binder that is meant for chest binding but is too small can also be dangerous. As a rule of thumb, you need to be able to take a full, deep breath while wearing the binder. To stay safe, try to minimize the number of hours you bind each day. 

Symptoms that may require medical attention while binding include but are not limited to dizziness, shortness of breath, fainting, major pain. *Never* bind while you sleep. Your breaths become slower and shallower when you’re unconscious, creating a dangerous combination.

### General Binding Safety/Comfort Tips

(Tips compiled from various sources. Specific thanks to u/x0klly0x for the last few.)

* Make sure to size yourself properly for a binder using the sizing guides found on the website you are buying it from. If you fall between sizes, buy a size up. NEVER buy a binder that is too small for you in the hope that it will compress your chest better.
* Avoid binding for more than 6-8 hours at a time (without breaks). It is okay to do this occasionally, but you increase your risk of causing damage to your ribs, lungs, and chest tissue if you make a habit of it.
* If you can, take your binder off throughout the day to give your body a break--even if it's just for a few minutes in the bathroom.
* Never sleep in your binder as it will restrict your breathing.
* If you are new to binding, do not start binding all day right away; work your body up to it by wearing it for short intervals to begin with, and gradually increase the amount of time you spend wearing it.
* When you remove your binder, take several deep breaths that completely fill your lungs and force yourself to cough once or twice. 
* You may also want to stretch your back/shoulders after removing your binder, as it can cause soreness.
* Don't pull the binder down too far in the front. This can make the shoulder straps dig into your shoulders and causes upper back/shoulder pain. If you're feeling tight/sore in your shoulders after binding, you might be doing this.
* Your binder size might change, be sure to buy new ones when you outgrow the old ones. If you find yourself sore, have trouble taking deep breaths, experience pain in the collarbone area, then it's time to size up.
* Conversely, binders do stretch out with extended use. If you find that your binder is not compressing your chest as well as it used to, you can run it through the dryer to try and shrink it (at your own risk) but you may have to get a new one. Different brands stretch out at different rates (gc2b is known for stretching out the fastest).
* If your brand new binder is itchy or irritates your skin, try wearing it inside out until it's broken in a little bit, or wearing a cotton undershirt underneath.
