# Cutting Implants

According to the 2018 [West London Menopause and Premenstrual Syndrome Service Guidelines](https://www.chelwest.nhs.uk/services/womens-health-services/gynaecology-services/menopause-and-pms-clinics/links/CWMENOPAUSEPMSguidelines2014v3.2.pdf) both estrogen and testosterone implants can be cut in half if a reduced dosage is required. Note that its very unlikely you'll be able to store and keep the other half.

&gt; Estrogen dose ... Low  dose  25  mg.  May  be  adequate  and  still  give  bone  protection (implant can be cut in half)

&gt; Testosterone dose ... Low  dose  75  mg,  50  mg  or  even  25  mg  if  androgen  side  effects  occur  (implant may be cut)

&amp;nbsp;

# Location of Implant

The most common location for implants appears to be in the butt with subsequent implants going into alternating sides and into the same location as previously so that there's no additional scars after the first two. I have two small scars that are not easily seen - I've never been able to turn around far enough to see mine, and I have to point them out for others to notice. In one of the YouTube video's the scars are much larger, presumably due to the ability of the doctor.

Some doctors insert into the subprapubic region (ie groin), which I find quite disturbing. You'll also easily be able to see the scars. Some argue that this location is safer in that it avoids the risk of damage to the [sciatic nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve); personally think that if the doctor can't be trusted to find the correct location it's time to find another doctor.

Beverly Cosgrove (who runs the massive TransHRT group on Facebook) makes [this point](https://moderntranshormones.com/2017/11/01/subcutaneous-injection-of-hormones/) in advocating for use of the effective more intra-muscular injection (not implant) to the buttocks

&gt; First, one reason doctors have for refusing to allow their transsexual patients to inject themselves is fear that they might hit the Sciatic nerve. This mistake is almost unheard of when injections are done by trans women – the scare stories are nearly all of novice nurses doing this – but it’s been a pretext used by doctors to deny injection as an option to their patients.

# Trocars

A trocar is the surgical tool used to insert an implant/pellet. A reusable trocar can be used if the doctor has an autoclave is available, otherwise relativly cheap disposable torcars are available. In the long term reusable trocars are cheaper, but there's a much higher upfront cost (autoclaves are expensive and take space). There's other equipment required, and some suppliers sell a kit including trocar, syringe, needles, dressing, etc.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocar

Trocars are available from

* https://www.trocarkit.com - doctors in Sydney/Australia use these disposable trocars, but looks like they don't ship to Australia?
* https://trocarsupplies.com - doctors in Sydney/Australia appear to use this company
* http://www.femcare.net.au/femcare-products-hrt.htm - some doctors in Australia appear to use this company, this link does't say what size the troacar is, but I know they have 4.5mm trocars, probably part number HT-TCO-852 (Trocar &amp; Cannula Obturator, Sterile), pdf [here](https://www.rociallehealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RT01-047_IFU_for_TROCAR_CANNULA_OBTURATOR.pdf).
* https://www.elemiscorp.com - These appear to be the trocars used in a lot of the USA implant video's

* https://pellecome.com - See YouTube video [Revolutionary, Patented Pellet Insertion Device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft8rKwstZ-A) by Pellecome in 2021. I doubt you can buy these without signing up to their entire business package.

I have heard of doctors inserting an implants without a trocar, just using a scalpel blade, but this is a very crude method that is going to leave a substantial scar. Its also possible to insert an implant using a syringe, but again it seems like a bad idea. I'd avoid doctors who do this, unless there's no other choice.

## TheraPellet Atraumatic Trocar

Uses a proprietary blunt tripped trocar which is said (by the inventor Dr. Charles P. Virden) to produce less tissue tramua. He's [partnering with other doctors](https://therapellet.com/practice-partnership) to offer this "patented atraumatic trocar." and has an as yet empty site atrocars.com.

https://therapellet.com/atrocars-trocar-info - describes the usual 3.2mm, 4.5mm trocars, and also a larger 5.5mm trocar used to insert 300mg pellets. It also mentions the use of triamcinolone in the pellets, which is used by FarmaKeio/Evexipel. I assume these 300mg pellets are only testosterone, as much larger doses of testerone are required than estrogen and triamcinolone is intended to suppress extrusion which is far more common with testosterone.

# Pain

Before inserting the implant a local anesthetic of lidocaine is injected, otherwise it would no doubt be extremely painful. The "needle" of a trocar is *very* thick. With the local anesthetic the insertion of the implant is painless, however for some (me) the local anesthetic itself is extremely painful for a brief time as lidocaine is quite acidic.

See the wiki entry on [lidocaine inejections](w/TransWiki/local_anesthetic#wiki_lidocaine_injections)

# Tachyphylaxis

Doctors may warn you about tachyphylaxis when using implants. Its essentially a tolerance to estrogen, where you experience symptoms of low estrogen levels while actually having very high levels. Its easily avoided with the correct protocol and occurs if you get new implants based on symptoms (ie when you feel bad) rather than when your levels are actually low (using blood tests).

# Dependance

An occasional argument by doctors against implants and higher levels of estrogen is that its addictive. [Read more...](w/TransWiki/hrt/dependance)

# Low Estrogen Levels

Its possible to get implants and still have very low levels. My endo explained that to me that this can be due to them being encapsulated. On the positive side they will last a very long time when that happens.

# Psychological Effects of High Estrogen

I find high estrogen levels of interest from a psychological point of view

* Depression is very common in the trans community and anything that helps safely alleviate that is valuable.
* There's people working on high level estrogen for the physical benefits, but I'm not aware of anyone looking into the psychological side.
* On of the benefits of implants is that its very easy to achieve high and stable estrogen blood levels.
* When the Sydney endocrinologist [Dr Jon Hayes](w/TransWiki/hrt/jon-hayes) retired there were a small but significant number of trans women who were in serious psychological distress caused by the reduction in blood levels that then followed. These numbers and symptoms seem somewhat similar cis-women suffering PMDD.

# Testosterone Implants

Australian endocrinologist [Dr Jonathan Hayes](w/TransWiki/hrt/jon-hayes) has prescribed post-op women with low testosterone 50mg testosterone implants (the amount used in men is far higher). These implants are placed on top of the estrogen implants as they are more likely to extrude and you don't want them pushing the estrogen implants out.

Note that testosterone implants don't last as long as estrogen, so there's likely to be a shortfall in levels before the estrogen implant needs renewing.

# Progesterone Implants

Australian endocrinologist [Dr Jonathan Hayes](w/TransWiki/hrt/jon-hayes) has prescribed progesterone implants, but they are prone to extrusion (about 10% at one point).

reddit

* [AMA: I've been on estrogen implants for 1 year and progesterone implants for 4 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/gghgl3/ama_ive_been_on_estrogen_implants_for_1_year_and/) by  rand0trans0 in 2020


There's a discussion in the 1952 [Ciba Foundation Symposium ‐ Steroid Hormone Administration (Book II of Colloquia on Endocrinology), Volume 3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470715154) page 279 on progesterone implants

&gt; We also noticed a tendency to extrusion, which is particularly noticeable for progesterone. One can almost go so far as to say that if one implants progesterone subcutaneously, it will certainly come out. Now that we have been using intramuscular implantation of progesterone with a trocar and cannula, we seldom get any extrusion at all.

# Bovine Implants

Hormone implants has been used in cattle for around 60 year. I've seen them on eBay, but unlike implants for human use they have a solid non-absorbing core and are not at all suitable for people.

An example is the Elanco Compusdose with 21.1mg,  25.7mg and 43.9mg oestradiol-17ß.

* https://www.elanco.com.au/products-services/beef-cattle/products/cattle-compudose - *"Compudose™ 100, 200 and 400 contain oestradiol-17ß, a naturally-occurring oestrogen. Each formulation consists of an inert* ***silicone rubber core*** *covered with a coating of oestradiol-medicated* ***silicone rubber.*** *The durable core helps in preventing crushing or breaking during implantation, ensuring consistent pay out and long-term performance."*

Both estradiol 50mg and testosterone 100mg implants are unlicensed products. Implants are usually given every 6-8 months, but not more frequently. A blood test is required every 6 to 12 months to monitor your hormone levels with the dose and frequency changed accordingly if necessary. Our guidelines follow safe practice to ensure normal therapeutic blood levels are maintained. The normal estradiol range is 300-600pmol but exceptionally a higher limit may be agreed."*

There no complications in all 14 transwomen studied... This study is the first study to look into the use of oestrogen implant in transwomen. It not only improves symptoms but also improves lipid profile in transwomen. Therefore, oestrogen implant treatment is a safe and effective therapy with high patient satisfaction. It should be considered as a form of replacement in transwomen who do not respond to other forms of oestrogen therapy."*

# Manufacturers

## Australia

There are two main manufacturers of estrogen implants in Australia, Complementary Compounding Services (CCS) in Ballina and Stenlake in Sydney, plus a couple of others. CCS do make both 3mm and 4.5mm implants, and while Stenlake are known of the 4.5mm implants I believe they can also make the 3mm implants. The reason for either size are discussed above in [Implant Technology](w/TransWiki/hrt/implants#wiki_implant_technology).

* https://custommedicine.com.au/
* https://www.stenlake.com.au/

See [Compounding Pharmacies in Australia](w/TransWiki/compounding-pharmacies/australia) for more.

The 4.5mm implant size is a legacy of the international pharmaceutical company manufacturer (Organon Laboratories Limited) that stopped production in 2011. Stenlake produced compatible implants and the endo Dr Jonathan Hayes made a special smaller size for unknown reasons.

[Stenlake's](https://www.stenlake.com.au/estradiol-implants-pellets/) pellets are pure (no exipients) compressed estradiol, 4.5mm diameter.

This video shows an Australian transwomen having an implant inserted (not by Hayes). The size of the scar and technique are interesting, and personally I'll be asking any doctor I go to how they perform this procedure.

* [HRT sub dermal compound implant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZV6W8feEqA) by Gabreiella Janice Wissell in 2015.

Dr Hayes used a different location and made a much smaller scar.

Australian Compounding pharmacies require a prescription from an Australian doctor. It is not possible to export using a foreign doctor.

They make up to 50mg estradiol implants, ship to most USA states (but not Michigan). They can ship estradiol pellets internationally, depending on local laws, but not to Canada. They have shipped to Austalia (my endo has used them in the past). Their pellets are compressed, not heat fused.

* 2021 - [BHRT Pellet Procedure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZO5BUfl2B0) by Gray Erlacher, MD - Clinic 180 - note this shows a pellet in a glass ampule and its notable that there's no protective material inside the ampule, unlike the Organon pellets that uses sterile cotton wool. It wouldn't be surprising if these got damaged in shipping, but perhaps its not a problem as they only make small pellets.

* [Compounding Pharmacy and Testosterone | BHRT | Qualgen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO678euo4Aw) by John C Lin in 2021 - an interview with Qualgen

There's a photo of a Qualgen pellet on [this page](https://www.qualgen.us/bhrt) of their site and it looks like it may be injection moulded, in which case they would be the only manufacturer I'm aware of who currently make heat fused pellets. However they do say the compress the pellets

&gt; Qualgen's pellets are formed by compressing bio-identical hormone ingredients into very small cylinders a little larger than a grain of rice, approximately 3 millimeters in diameter. 

They [also say](https://www.qualgen.us/estradiolpellets)

&gt; Qualgen's estradiol pellets are the purest bio-identical pellets on the market. Qualgen pellets are one of the only pellets that are 99.5% pure estradiol and are completely bio-identical. Qualgen uses no other binding agents or chemicals in our pellet production process that are not 100% natural bio-identicals.

This statement appears to contradict the photo on that same page showing a bottle containing a "Estradiol 18mg Pellet" with "USP .95% Stearic Acid NF". Presumably a *very very* careful intepretation would be that the stearic acid is "100% natual bio-identical".

### SottoPelle

Note that appearaneces to the contrary, SottoPelle do not manufacture pellets. I'm not sure what they actually do, but it appears to be more of a marketing organisation. Regardless, I'nm of the opinion that they have nothing of interest to the trans community.

Legal

* https://casetext.com/case/lyons-v-gorens - 06-04-2021, *The SottoPelle defendants (collectively known as SottoPelle) promote the use of hormone replacement therapy using bioidentical hormone infused pellets (hormone pellets). The SottoPelle entities were managed by Dr. Gino Tutera, who passed away in 2015, and his wife, CarolAnn Tutera. Lyons was implanted with hormone pellets by Dr. Marsha Gorens, who attended SottoPelle educational conferences and was a SottoPelle Certified Physician. Lyons was later diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. As the case progressed, plaintiffs changed their theory of SottoPelle's liability. In plaintiffs' original complaint, they asserted that SottoPelle designed, manufactured, and sold hormone pellets. In a proposed amended complaint, plaintiffs asserted that SottoPelle was liable as an apparent manufacturer and under an enterprise theory. ...  Responding to the question of whether any of the SottoPelle entities were the manufacturer of the hormone pellets used to treat Lyons, SottoPelle stated: "No. None of the SottoPelle Defendants are manufacturers of hormone pellets nor did they manufacture the pellets at issue. The SottoPelle Defendants have no knowledge of who manufactured the pellets at issue. The SottoPelle Defendants are familiar with Solutions Pharmacy in Tennessee as a manufacturer of pellets but cannot say for certain that they manufactured the pellets at issue in this case."*
