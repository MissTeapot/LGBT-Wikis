# About This Page

**The following list of frequently asked questions has been compiled by the moderators of /r/FtM and /r/MtF as a resource list for transgender people on reddit. This is an MAAB trans person specific list; an FAAB list can be found at /r/FtM.**

This page is both the FAQ page for basic questions regarding those just beginning their inquiries into transition, and also a map-reference for other FAQ pages. Please see below for guides to coming out, presenting, passing and self-help.

To search this list, please use either Ctrl+F (the find-in-page function), or check the table of contents. You may find your question has been answered here. If it has, but you need clarification, please don't be afraid to submit a question to the general userbase, or search the subreddit using reddit's search function for your question. 

If your question is regarding fetishism of yourself or other transgender people, please bear in mind that this is a non-sexual community. Instead, please try searching Google for NSFW subreddits involving transgender people. We kindly ask that you refrain from asking questions of a fetishistic or sexualised nature, and that any content that is incidentally explicit (e.g. a photograph of a tattoo that happens to contain your genitalia) be tagged as NSFW.

## Gender Identity and Questioning

---

### ***I’m questioning my gender. How do I know if I’m trans?***

One of the most repeated pieces of advice is, “Only you can really know.” Whilst this isn't very helpful, it's really the best piece of advice we can give you. You are the only one who can truly decide if you are trans or not, and attempts to take that decision away from you should be scorned.

But what if you don’t know? The best way to understand your feelings on gender and decide whether you want to transition is to examine your feelings from day to day. Keep a journal about how you feel about your gender, and talk to someone whom you trust. Talking to a therapist who is experienced in gender issues can be very helpful. If possible, experiment with your presentation—try dressing more feminine, wearing breastforms, getting a haircut, and see how you feel. Give yourself plenty of time to figure this all out. 

If you are unsure of whether or not you should go to see a psychologist, psychiatrist or therapist, there are a few questions you can ask:

1. *"If there was a button that would let me change, completely, totally and permanently, into another gender, would I press it?"*

2. *"Does the thought of being another gender make me feel happier, more comfortable in myself, or more at peace with my life?"*

3. *"Have I ever had repeated idle thoughts about being another gender, or continually wish that I was born differently, ending in feeling upset or disappointed that it wasn't true?"*

These are not the only questions you can ask, but they're good starts!

### ***When I was a child I didn't do typically "female" things or call/think of myself as a girl. Could I still be trans?***
    
Yes. Many men, both cis and trans, were not overtly like their identified gender as children. Some trans women claimed themselves to be girls when they were children, but many did not. Some don't begin transition until their late 40s, or even 50s. We are informed by our parents and by society what is expected of us—to be male, masculine children—and it can be very difficult to start questioning that message. Indoctrination into a specific mindset can be very hard to break, and you might have repressed memories of your questioning your gender when you were younger. Talking with a therapist or licensed mental health care professional may help sort out these issues.

### ***I don’t feel that much discomfort with living life as a male, and it has never really been a serious issue for me. Could I still be trans?***
    
Yes, you could well still be trans. Some trans women live happily as males for many years, occasionally well into middle age and having raised families, before realizing they want to transition. If you’re questioning whether or not you are trans, it helps to sit down and think deeply about why you’re questioning this. Maybe you've never been too uncomfortable living as a male, but when you start exploring, you find that you'd much rather live as a female. Perhaps you had idle thoughts about it at a younger age, but dismissed it as impossible or not appropriate.

For some people, beginning to explore gender results in a heightening of dysphoria that may have gone unnoticed prior. Reflecting on your feelings about gender is a great way to work through this question, but don't feel concerned if your dysphoria spikes. You might find that you identify more with another identity under the trans umbrella such as genderqueer, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming, which is great too. 

If you didn't experience gender dysphoria before identifying yourself as transgender, don't worry about it. This is very normal, and is the result of heightened awareness of oneself. It doesn't mean you're "convincing" yourself that you're trans, just that you're realising all the issues that weren't noticed before, and perhaps manifested as general body stress or image issues.

### ***I have little to no body dysphoria (distress with my primary and secondary sex characteristics). Could I still be trans∗?***
    
Yes. Not everyone experiences dysphoria in the same way; some people have very little of it, or even no dysphoria about a particular aspect such as the genitals. Ask yourself, what does cause you gender-related distress? Maybe it’s being called "he" or "man", having short hair, having facial hair or lacking breasts.

Some people will tell you that people with no physical dysphoria are not trans, and that social dysphoria is really just internalized sexism. Ignore these people. However, if you’re seeking medical treatment as a part of your transition you should be aware of some current definitions that doctors use. [The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \(DSM-V\)](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) describes Gender Dysphoria as “including strong desires to be treated as the other gender, or to be rid of one’s sex characteristics, or a strong conviction that one has feelings and reactions typical of the other gender.” These are the three main ways gender dysphoria can manifest. 

The DSM specifies that for a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria, your condition must cause “significant distress or impairment” in your life. So if you have no body dysphoria but you are distressed by something else, like being referred to as ‘she’ rather than ‘he’, then you do fit the diagnostic criteria for Gender Dysphoria.

Please note that the DSM's listing of gender dysphoria as a mental health condition does *not* imply that transgender people are mentally ill. Gender dysphoria is a negative aspect of being trans, and it is listed as a mental health condition because it harms those who experience it. The actual "being-trans" aspect that causes dysphoria is no longer considered by the psychological community to be a disorder of any kind. Additionally, by listing gender dysphoria, many insurance companies that would not otherwise do so are more inclined to support transgender people financially during transition.

### ***How can I “test” whether I want to transition?***
    
There are many non-permanent changes you can make to get a feel for presenting as female, or for possibly transitioning in the future. While you’re doing these things, ask yourself how you like it and how it makes you feel.

* Try wearing simple feminine clothing. Go to a charity shop with a trusted friend or partner, and obtain some feminine clothing such as a blouse top or skirt. This can be very daunting, as society is much harsher on those it perceives to be male wearing feminine clothing than the reverse, but if anyone asks just say you're going to a costume party or similar. Charity shops/thrift stores are often where people go if they need costume materials, and a friend or relative with you could do a world of good.

* Ask a trusted friend or family member to start referring to you with a female name and female or gender-neutral pronouns. Many transgender people start out by asking people to use "they" instead of "he" or "she", and this is completely acceptable.  

* Consider presenting yourself as female online if you aren’t able to confide in somebody in real life. /r/MtF is a great place to try this, as we're a very accepting place and we fully support non-binary identities.

* Try purchasing a simple bra online or from a discount variety store, big-box store or similar (e.g. Kmart, Target, Asda, Carrefour, etc), and stuffing it with socks or breastforms. 

* Try getting a more feminine haircut, especially androgynous-to-feminine ones that can be worn before you begin transition. Be sure to specifically ask the hairdresser for a feminine style cut, such as a pixie cut, rather than simply a less masculine style.

* Try on some easily-removed makeup like non-staining lipsticks, eyeshadow or foundation. Note, mascara and staining makeups can be extremely hard to remove at short notice, since they tend to adhere strongly to the skin and hair. Nail polish is easy to remove if you have nail polish remover, but do ensure that you have the right remover for the polish or else it will be practically impossible to remove. Nail polish remover comes in two varieties, acetone and non-acetone, so check both your bottle of polish and the bottle of remover before purchasing.

### ***Is being transgender the same as being gay or bisexual? Can I still be attracted to women even though I'm transgender?***

Absolutely. One's gender identity and sexual orientation are completely separate, and do not affect one another more than terminology. As a transgender woman, you might identify as straight, in which case you would be attracted to men, lesbian, bisexual or pansexual, asexual, or many other completely valid sexual identities. Transgender lesbians are quite common, particularly in those who transition later in life and already have a wife and family.

Gender identity and sexual orientation are affected by different things in the brain, and so you shouldn't feel uncomfortable being transgender and still being attracted to women. Most people do find that hormone replacement therapy affects their libido (how often they feel sexually aroused) either positively (increasing) or negatively (decreasing), but this does not affect sexual orientation. It only affects how often you desire sex, and how your orgasms might work.

### ***My religious convictions state that being transgender is a sin. How can I reconcile this with my gender identity?***

Unfortunately, there is no simple answer here that this guide can give you. Each person's religious beliefs are solely their own, and nobody else has a right to dictate to you how you should think, feel or believe. However, if you do require religious guidance, I recommend you contact your religious leader, or whoever else you consider to be an authority on the subject. Christians who feel conflicted might like to try /r/OpenChristian, an LGBT-accepting Christian subreddit.

### ***I think I'm transgender, and I feel a need to transition, but I don't hate my genitals. Am I really trans?***

Yes; non-operative binary transgender people are real, and no less trans than those who absolutely cannot stand not having GRS (genital reassignment surgery). Additionally, non-binary transgender people who nevertheless feel a need to hormone therapy or other medical interventions are completely real too, and you should talk with a trusted confidante and/or a mental health care professional about which you think you might be.

### ***I don't know if I really want to transition, or if it's just a fetish. How can I tell?***

This is a complex issue, but I think the fact that you're asking this question has already given you a hint as to what the answer might be. Transgender women are, for a number of sociological reasons, a common object of fetishisation and objectification, and so it's only natural to be concerned this may simply be a fetish of some kind. However, you can address this issue by considering the following:

1. Do you feel a desire to be female that extends beyond simple satisfaction of sexual desires?
2. When you dress as a female, do you feel an inner satisfaction or happiness that extends beyond sexual gratification?
3. If you could permanently change your gender to female, irreversibly and completely, would you do it?

There are many other questions you can ask too, but those are the primary ones. Please note, for question 2, many transgender people do feel sexual gratification from dressing as their identified gender. This is often because they find that it makes them feel more comfortable being sexual, rather than due to any inherent gratification of a fetishised desire. If you become aroused dressing as a female, this does not invalidate your status as trans, but it might give you food for thought.
