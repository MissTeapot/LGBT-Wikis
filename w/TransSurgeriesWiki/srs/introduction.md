# Types of Surgery

***This is MTF/AMABF surgery only. The index page contains a few links to FTM/AFAB surgery.***

## SRS

The main techniques, in approximate order of popularity

* **Penile-inversion** and its variations. The most common technique and is practiced by most surgeons.
* **Non-penile inversion** and its variations practiced in Thailand. Said by some to be superior to penile inversion.
* **Colonvaginoplasty**. Not much known about this compared to the other techniques and conflicting reports about it, ranging from significant problems to superior results.
* **Peritoneal**. Fairly new for trans surgery, but becomming quite popular.
* **Penectomy**. Removal of the penis.
* **Nullification**. Removing the genitals entirely.
* **Penile Preservation Vaginoplasty**. Surgery to get a vaginal while keeping the penis. This surgery is relativly recent.

There's lot of different names/acronyms for this, and I'm just using SRS out of long term habit.  Also GRS, GCS, GAS.

## Non-Penile Inversion

Suporn, Chettawut, probably others in Thailand.




&amp;nbsp;
*****
## Colonvaginoplasty

Sometimes used after an initial SRS has failed or depth is not sufficient. Has more restricted BMI requirements than other SRS techniques (eg Chettawut less than BMI 28 vs 35, age less than 45, weight less 80kg).

Olmec in India have a variation on this technique.

The procedure went normally and healed well. Everything else is intact, I never ended up having GCS. I was grateful to never have to feel testicular pain ever again, but I was wrong! A couple of weeks ago I did yoga for the first time in years and ended up thinking I pulled a muscle in my groin area... I was admitted to the hospital the following day, skipping me ahead of a bunch of people because of the whimpering and clawing at my seat in the lobby... The searing agony came back in just a time for them to put me on heavy medication and kept me overnight. Once they had the MRI they found that one of my spermatic cords had gotten tangled in the inguinal canal and seemingly pinched with an artery. It then got swollen and stuck there... They said they'd perform surgery if it comes back. If I did have surgery, the surgeon would have made an incision in the pelvic region a couple inches above the swelling and snipped the spermatic cord higher up so it could never tangle again. So... if you're thinking about getting an orchi it couldn't hurt to ask your surgeon to snip a little higher, right? lol"*

When having my canal added later that alone seemed to take longer - even though all the exterior and clitoris was already done and in tact. ...  Just because I could have mine added after the fact, it was super difficult to get! I had issue with insurance and other things....it very well could have cost me out of pocket had my surgeon not been so involved. He was also a bit hesitant on doing it, and now I have a permanent scar across my lowe abdomen, so bathing suits are gonna be a bit difficult to find the right one and such. Also I had to go through two medical leaves (12 weeks total) but I was fortunate to ha e a good position with a caring company - so that wasn't too much of an issue. ...Just be 100% sure you want to go zero depth! Its not easy and its not always possible (per my surgeon) to have it added later. "*

I went this route mainly due to major dysphoria and I was only interested in aesthetics. However, this surgery did something major for me - my dysphoria is all but non existent anymore! I'm sure coming out and getting name changed and all played a big part there. What I notice now is I love who I am, and I feel very good about myself- something I have NEVER felt. This has also made me realize something else -while zero depth wasn't a regrettable choice, I now feel there is more to life, things I was never interested in prior as they never gave me any thoughts, now, probably because I feel so damn good, I see as options! I wont go into details there. ...While I have no regret going this route as I have the aesthetics I wanted, I do wish I'd have felt about myself how I feel now back then as I would have made another decision."*

## Non-binary Surgery

This referes to the surgery itself, rather than a person who's non-binary having a traditional surgery. For that, look under [Real Life Experience](w/TransSurgeriesWiki/srs/introduction#wiki_real_life_experience_.28rle.29).

While this section is for AMAB, it's also possible for AFAB to have simular results. See reddit users [nonbinaryphallo](https://www.reddit.com/user/nonbinaryphallo/submitted/) and [bonusdickboi](https://www.reddit.com/user/bonusdickboi/submitted/).

Surgeons who (probably) do this procedure include

* Peter Davis (USA) - *"For his gender non-conforming patients, Dr. Davis also performs gender nullification, also known as male to eunuch or “smoothie” procedures. The procedure includes a complete penectomy, orchiectomy, a reduction of the scrotal sac, and shortening of the urethra. The goal is to leave the area as a smooth unbroken transition from the abdomen to the groin. Although, an inconspicuous midline scar and shortened urethra will still be present. Dr. Davis does also offer the option of retaining the highly sedate distal penile tissue (which normally makes up the clitoris in a typical gender reassignment procedure), which he “buries” in the deep tissue of the lower mons above the urethra, akin to a “hidden” clitoris."* https://www.davisplasticsurgery.com/services/gender-nullification

My surgeon said it's the same surgery except for the things I didn't want like the labia and pocket for penetration. He even created a "clit" as he calls it. I tell people it's a button, because people associate a clit with a vagina. I've had a a very good experience with him, he's very direct and easy to work with, and answers questions completely. He responded to email very quickly, even on his surgery days. The people I know who have had the vaginoplasty are taking testosterone, and live as a male socially, as I continue to do, now with no genitals. The fact that this surgeon will help people transition MtF, those who want a "mangina" (their own term, not mine) and Male to Nullo shows he's very flexible. I highly recommend him. My own therapist retired during the pandemic, and my letters were too old for the insurance to accept, but he even recommended a therapist that works with him and it made things so easy."*

**Virtual Penectomy**

This involves injection of local anesthetic into the nerves of the penis to remove sensation. It's supposed to be temporary, but can apparently result in a permanent loss of sensation. If you were to have SRS later on I'd assume you would continue to have no sensation. It seems like a really bad idea.

## Other Techniques

### Keeping Testicles

Keeping them attached rather than taking them home. That's elsewhere on this page.

A post on Susans says that keeping testicles after SRS (by moving to the abdomen) has been done in the past, that it was common in the 1950's, started by [Elmer Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Belt), and that a Tess Cowen had done it.

* [Vaginoplasty Results: Dr. Toby Meltzer](https://web.archive.org/web/20000511075432/http://www.annelawrence.com/meltzer1297.html) - *"This patient wanted to keep her testicles as an aid to preserving her sexual responsiveness, and Dr. Meltzer was persuaded to comply with her request. He positioned the testes between the skin and the muscles of the abdominal wall to permit examination by the patient and her physicians. In this view, "n" indicates the patient's navel, and "(t)" the testes, with the patient's fingers on either side. For more information about this remarkable technique -- and the remarkable woman who requested it -- I recommend reading J. J. Allen's "Meet Tess -- A New Dance of Scalpel and Soul" in Transgender Tapestry, Summer 1998, pp. 56-57."* - links to
    * [Meet Tess: A New Dance of Scalpel and Soul](https://web.archive.org/web/20080621075306/http://www.jenellerose.com/htmlpostings/meet_tess_a_new_dance_of_scalpel_and_soul.htm) by By J. J. Allen, first published in Transgender Tapestry #83, Summer 1998. - *"After much consideration and some consultation, Tess underwent a unique medical procedure. While penile inversion was performed, the testes were not removed. Instead, the surgeon relocated them superior and anterior to the inguinal canals, approximating the location of the ovaries in a genetic female. While men with undescended testicles face an increased risk of testicular cancer, no studies have been done on the risks posed by the surgical re-ascension of the testicles. In Dr. Cowell's case, the testes lie just below the dermis, so that they can be palpated to a certain degree for examination. A full examination, though, requires the use of a modern radioimaging device, a procedure which Tess will undergo at regular intervals for the rest of her life."* - note the trans patient is Dr Tess Cowell.

Undescended testicles have a higher risk of cancer than normal, and are often removed. This suggests that not removing testcles during SRS would increase the risk of cancer, but I'm not aware of any studies (and there probably aren't any due to the small numbers doing this)

On the other hand, SITTERS has to consider that there are potential complications and consequences that will arise from this altered anatomy.””"* - this article is on many other sites

So, yesterday he came over to my apartment. The procedure I was completely awake for and it was horrible, horrible pain. My testicles kept going back inside my scrotum so he kept having to push them out. Then he got one off and the artery started bleeding. He sutured it (badly) and then got the other one out and off. By the end of it I had been screaming and writihing in pain, but he finished and I was so happy to have them gone. He left me and my partner for me to rest in bed. Well, about ten minutes later I heard what sounded like water being poured onto the bed and there was blood everywhere. It was just gushing. So, my partner called the paramedics. They came and got me into the ambulence which was hard because I live on the second floor and I could not stand up without possibly completely bleeding out. I got to the hospital and they put me into proper surgery. They reopened me up, cleaned me out, made sure to remove any debris the first guy left over and now I am still here, still in immense pain. The police were called by the hospital too and my unlicensed surgeon is now under investigation. I feel a little bad for him since he was such a nice guy, or seemed to be...  The "Surgeon" was arrested last night so he will not be able to do his risky business again. While I feel kind of bad for him, after reading comments here I think it is probably for the best."*

### Post-Op Anatomy

I'll collect a few results here to illustrate various points of post-op results. I find it helpful to look wth legs closed, open, and internally/labia apart as different things can be seen in each. Sometimes what looks very good with legs closed is not so good with legs apart or labia spread. In particular look closely at the labia majora, labia minora, anterior commissure, posteriour commissure, inside vulva. Some problems of SRS, eg assymetry of labia, can be fixed or improved by revision, but I don't know how that varies among surgeons.

In porn its quite common to obscure the view with hands or toys, and presumably its intentionally as sometimes you'll never find a photo without that.

## Stopping HRT Before Surgery

Most surgeons require HRT to be stopped before surgery. The main exception appears to be implants/pellets for which you would time the surgery for when estrogen levels are low.

WPATH 8 Standards of Care (2022) say stopping estrogen before surgery is no longer necessary.

* http://marcibowers.com/transfem/resources/faq/#discontinue-my-hormones - *"The time-honored dogma for patients undergoing vaginoplasty is that estrogens increase the risk for blood clots and that all hormones must be discontinued. This suspension of hormones leaves patients moody, depressed, achy and overall not feeling well around the time of surgery. On the other hand, we do not stop hormones or birth control pills in natal women undergoing gynecologic surgery. My feeling is that those same rules can apply for our patient population so long as we drop doses as low as possible. Such has been our philosophy since 2003 without incident. We do not interfere with those who have already discontinued their HRT on the advice of their home physicians or specialists. Dropping the dose as low as possible 4 weeks prior to surgery is our current advice except in patients with higher risk."*

* https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/feminizing-hormone-therapy - *"There is no evidence to suggest that transgender women who lack specific risk factors (smoking, personal or family history, excessive doses or use of synthetic estrogens) must cease estrogen therapy before and after surgical procedures, in particular with appropriate use of prophylaxis and an informed consent discussion of the pros and cons of discontinuing hormone therapy during this time. Possible alternatives include using a lower dose of estrogen, and/or changing to a transdermal route if not already in use."*

Evidence suggests there is no need to discontinue either testosterone or spironolactone, although their association with perioperative outcome quality has not been studied in depth.

## Real Life Experience (RLE)

The [WPATH Standards of Care](https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc) version 7 require (page 106) one year of living in your preferred gender (and HRT) before genital surgery. The one year is known as [RLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_experience_\(transgender\)), or sometimes RLT (Real Life Test) as in you don't get your SRS without passing it. Note that the WPATH SOC is not a legal requirement, surgeons are not required to follow it, and it is open to some interpretation. See the wiki introduction page on [Medical Guidelines](w/TransSurgeriesWiki/index#wiki_medical_guidelines) for more. Note also that version 8 of the WPATH SOC has some updates in related to this.

Its possible, though rare, to get SRS without even presenting/identifying female or having any intention of socially transitioning. Lots of trans people don't believe this is possible (and some believe it shouldn't be allowed). You must take estrogen or testosterone afer removing the testicles otherwise you'll be at risk of [osteoporosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis) (this is very bad) and other problems. As evidence its possible, and with reputable surgeons:

## Psychs for SRS letters

SRS letters are usually written in accordance with the requirmenents the [WPATH Standards Of Care](https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc) and the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \(DSM-5\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5).

The WPATH SOC is a set of best practices for treating transgender people, while the DSM-5 contains the standard [diagnostic criteria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) for being transgender.

Neither are laws nor are they absolutly required to get genital surgery, but its very difficult to find a surgeon/psych who doesn't follow them, or at least go through the motions. Insurance companies may make things even more difficult. Thailand does have laws on genital surgery that are not exactly the same as WPATH and requirements does vary somewhat between surgeons.

https://thegalap.org - *"The GALAP Movement. We are a group of transgender, nonbinary, and allied mental health clinicians in the U.S. who believe in improving access to letters for clients who are seeking gender-affirming medical care. We resist the harmful practices of gatekeeping and believe in an informed consent model where clients can affirm their gender identity without the steep cost of sessions with mental health professionals and reductionist clinical practices. As such, we want to create a movement towards to providing free and low-cost letters for gender affirming access to medical care."*

&amp;nbsp;
### Informed Consent

There's very few surgeons who do informed consent for genital surgery. If this is of interest its generally more practical find a psych who will write you a letter without making a big deal of it. Informed consent is common for other trans surgeries.

Informed consent genital surgeons

* Marc Arnkoff (Michigan, USA) - Orchiectomy
* Ivan Mañero Vazquez (Barcelona, Spain) - SRS
* Jesús Lago Oliver (Madrid, Spain) - Orchiectomy
* Jorge Saenz de Cabezón (Barcelona, Spain) - Orchiectomy

However, the literature often indicates that despite being "a simple operation" it was "not liked by some" or refers to the "untidy apron-like appearance" it could produce. Dorsal slit is now rare in Western countries as a treatment for phimosis. Standard guidelines suggest conservative approaches first and, should those fail, either circumcision or preputioplasty to both retain the foreskin and relieve the phimosis."*

&amp;nbsp;
#### High Testesterone

Its not common, but the the adrenal glands produce testosterone and after SRS or orchiectomy they can in some cases increase production to compensate for sudden loss.

From a [pdf about SRS with Suporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7jj0n4/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_update_2/)

&gt; The clinic’s ‘Post-Op Care’ book says that in about 10-15% of cases “unwanted male characteristics can return immediately post-operative” as the body attempts to make up for
the loss of testosterone and that the treatment is anti-androgens “for at least 3 months”. My doctor said much the same and prescribed low dose spironolactone (25mg) to allow my body to adjust. I took it for a few months, and as usual it fixed that problem.

## Dilation

Assuming no complications

1. Dilating is critical early post-op, and if you don't dilate you'll likley permanently lose depth. Permanent loss of depth can only be fixed with further surgery, possibly peritioneal or colon vaginolpasty. What early means is variable. It youre comtemplating stopping becuase its too painful I'd suggest looking  into stronger painkillers, because repeating SRS is not going to be a great experience and you might face the same problems again. Not all doctors/surgeons are willing to provide stronger painkillers.
2. Your body will tell you how often you need to dilate. If its easy you can expermient with dilating less often, but if it gets harder you need to dilate more. If you dilate less because its difficult it will get worse and worse.
If dilation is difficult you need to do it more, not less.
3. Long term there's many reports of women not dilating for years with no permaent loss of depth. It can however take some effort to regain depth.

Note that some cis-women dilate

Dilation was uncharacteristically painful. More painful than most people report. Severe, sharp, burning pain on the inside... I found small quantities (0.2g combusted) of it before each dilation session (3x day) to be a godsend. Smoked pure, no tobacco of course. I would compare the type of pain relief to opiates. You still have the pain but you don’t feel it properly because you’re too fuzzy. It was as ‘mind-numbing’ as strong opiates but without the addiction/danger, constipation and extreme sedation."*

Candles are known to have been used in Thailand as dilators until recently, but it goes back to at least 1898 (in the USA by the look of it), see the thesis [Dilating Health, Healthcare, and Well-Being: Experiences of LGBTQ+ Thai People](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37364623) by by Sowapark, Montita in 2019 (and see also the original source [New method of creating a vagina in a case of congenital absence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284040439_New_method_of_creating_a_vagina_in_a_case_of_congenital_absence) by R. Abbe in 1898).

&gt; After Robert Abbe performed one of the earliest vaginoplasty procedures in 1898 for a patient with vaginal agenesis,345 he reported that: The gravitation of the abdominal contents tended to shorten the vaginal canal, and I saw that it would be necessary for her to wear a vaginal plug part of every day at least. Several varieties were tried, but nothing was so comfortable as a good-sized wax candle smoothed and rounded, and kept in by a T-bandage.

Abstract. How can the epistemological tools and frameworks of biomedical engineering and critical gender studies be used to contest each other’s work, engender new collaborations, and broaden our conceptual horizons as to the limitations and potentials of each discipline? On one hand, this study asks how the Thai sex/gender system affects the health, healthcare, and well-being of LGBTQ. To answer this question, I conducted 32 in-depth semi-structured interviews with Thai LGBTQ+ patients and healthcare providers. By analyzing these themes using Michel Foucault’s theory of biopower..."* - I don't know what any of that means, but this thesis has looks at the design of existing and new dilators. I'm not sure I understand this as the author seems to be of Thai herritage and yet the proposed dilator designed seems over engineered and far to costly for Thai market (it's a poor country).

#### Milli Medical

Note that its not clear how suitable these for post-op trans women, and they are expensive (US$250 in 2021). And also note that they are doing a fair amount of marketing for this. They are 10.5cm (4 inches) so not useful for depth. The diameter is 15 to 40mm so it could be useful for the scar near the vaginal entrance. It appears to be more suitable as an additional dilator to your exising set to solve specific problems.

* [Mixed Emotions (Cured self and gave self new small problem)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vaginismus/comments/mcekdm/mixed_emotions_cured_self_and_gave_self_new_small/) in 2021 - *"A long time ago, I bought an inflatable plug with the intention of inflating it and birthing it. ... Over time, I was able to get it in uninflated, but with no hope of getting it out equally uninflated. A few weeks ago, I decided to try again. I got it to a size that was probably as thick as a wrist, more or less, and pushed it out. I was very turned on and excited by being able to do this. It burnt just a tiny bit, but it was absolutely nothing in comparison to vaginismus at it's worst. The toy was a pain level I could enjoy as a sadomasochist, which was absoloutely never something I could say about vaginismus. But afterwards, I was touching myself, and I was just... in awe of how "loose" it was. I almost fisted myself, but not quite. I figured this was just in the moment and would snap back to the regular tightness, like how it does/did after dilating or sex, but... it didn't entirely. In the weeks following, I found myself putting a finger in with ease and being totally amazed. It was always difficult to get a finger in before, always, and now I could just do it anytime. I would do it just to prove to myself that it still worked. Whether I was masturbating or just sitting around by myself, I'd do it just to feel how easy it was. I wondered if this meant I was cured, if this is what a normal vagina feels like. ... So, the day before yesterday, I attempted sex without dilating first, and IT WORKED! It went in easily and naturally, with no preparation, like never before, and it felt GOOD! And at first, this is wonderful."*
* [Biggest dilator goes only halfway](https://www.reddit.com/r/vaginismus/comments/3nul6r/biggest_dilator_goes_only_halfway/) around 2015 - *"I also got myself a small inflatable dildo (it’s the 6 inches inflatable dildo from Lovehoney, if anyone is interested). It’s a great tool, because it’s not as rigid as a plastic dilator, and you can gradually make it bigger when it is already inside of you. With the help of the dildo, I’m now at the point where I can insert the biggest dilator of my set (I have the Velvi kit)."*

#### Sybian/Motorbunny

These are very expensive sex toys and are included due to a post on susans on their use for dilation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybian - *"A Sybian (/ˈsɪbiən/), or Sybian saddle, is a masturbation device. It consists of a hollow saddle-like seat containing two electric motors, motor speed controller boards, gearing, pulleys, and a platform on cranked axles such that a ridge on the top of the unit can be made to vibrate through a range of speeds as set using a wired external hand controller, and an upward-pointing shaft set on an angle through the ridge can be made to rotate at speeds of up to several hundred rpm, again by use of the wired remote control. Flexible molded attachments are supplied that fit over the vibrating ridge and shaft which mostly have integrated dildos on their top. In use, the rider inserts the dildo into a bodily cavity for internal stimulation while applying pressure on the vibrating ridge with their external erogenous parts."*

At the 4 week mark dilation became painful. It became an extreme pain and would bring me to tears. I continued to dilate 30 minutes 5 times a day with 1-4 dilators. I had to have an operation to remove the scar tissue. I lost depth due to the operation. I was 3.5 inched deep post the second operation... I was going to get peritoneal GCS due to the depth issue. I was instructed by RBL to get a doctor the demonstrate pelvic floor  exercises to increase depth. I did and it was my primary care doctor. They see thousands of trans. I then thought that a sybian would do the exercises for me. It did and I had orgasms too. My depth is between the 5th dot and horizontal slit with my labia at the slit. I was fully healed when I did this. I used motor bunny xl toys on the sybian.*

### Lube

Be careful with lube in the first few months after surgery, use water based lubes as other chemicals can interfere with healing.

Ingredients of concern are

* Glycerin/glycerine/glycerol - yeast infections
* [Propylene Glycol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylene_glycol) - vaginal irritation
* [Chlorhexedine Gluconate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine) - disinfectant and antiseptic (kills good bacteria), irritation. This is an ingredient in [surgilube](https://surgilube.com/what-is-chlorhexidine-gluconate/) - *"CHG products are generally safe to be used by most individuals. However, you should not use products that contain chlorhexidine gluconate if you are allergic to CHG, as there’s a possibility of serious allergic reaction."*
* [Nonoxynol-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonoxynol-9) - spermicide, kills good bacteria
* Petroleum based ingredients, oily and won't wash out, can upset pH leading to infections (eg BV)
* Benzyl alcohol - irritation
* Citric acid - irritation

Chlorhexidine gluconate had a detrimental effect on Lactobacillus growth and exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity compared with methylparaben and propylparaben... This in vitro model indicates that select vaginal lubricants, particularly those with chlorhexidine gluconate, have potentially adverse effects on women's health by reducing growth and recolonization of vaginal Lactobacillus species."*

Marci Bowers (SRS surgeon) - http://marcibowers.com/mtf/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/05/Discharge-instructions-for-GRS-edited-revisions-no-phone-number.pdf - *"There will be some blood-tinged discharge on your pads for at least a few weeks This diminishes as healing advances. Odor will change from a somewhat foul‘healing odor’ to a more natural ‘feminine odor’ over 6-12 weeks. Douching during this period with warm water and capful of vinegar is acceptable. Beyond 12 weeks, douching is discouraged as it depletes the vagina of bacteria that maintain the normal vaginal health and well-being."*

UCSF Center of Excellence for Transgender Health [Vaginoplasty procedures, complications and aftercare](http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=guidelines-vaginoplasty) by Toby Meltzer (SRS Surgeon) - *"Initially the patient should douche daily during frequent dilation.

* Douche once a day? My surgeon said to stop at 2 months. Most people seem to stop once they get past the initial stages of healing... Dr. Sutin - PAI
* My surgeon was Brassard in Montreal, his instructions are to douche once a day forever to prevent dead cells from accumulating and causing infection.
* My gifriend had hers from brassard 3 years ago and she just douches once a week after her dilation. Even talking to her about it now shes pretty confused by it.
* Apparently others who have been to Brassard have stopped / reduced their douching without adverse effects, although Brassard's instructions indicate that you'll basically die if you skip it for any length of time.
* I've douched one time in two years, probably against medical advice. (Bowers)
* My girlfriend went to Brassard about 18 months ago and I don't think she's douched in like a year.
* I stopped douching about 3 months ago and I've had no problems.

* Do you clean your vagina in the shower or do you need to douche everytime? Shower only. Haven't touched since like 3 months post-op.
* I very rarely douche anymore. Theres no weird discharge so I dont really worry about it. Just wash it down in the shower.
* I clean it like my first gf taught me. Get all the junk out of the folds, but don't wash inside. The insides take care of themselves. 
* I wash my vulva in the shower. You shouldn't be cleaning the vagina out unless you have a yeast infection or when you're early in post op. The neo vagina cleans itself and douching damages it's internal flora which it uses to keep itself clean - although it takes a couple of months to reach this point.
* Just the shower. Don't douche hardly ever. 
* Just clean in the shower.
* No, I use baby wipes to clean up any mess, then shower when appropriate.
* I douche when the dilator comes out stinky. Yes. I sniff it every time.

* Douching is important post-SRS...at least that's how Menard did it...We had to douche after dilating for a few months as I recall...then it was just douche when you feel you need it. Now so many years out, I only douche when I think about it, which is rarely.

With Suporn, I gained about 1.5 inches in the first 2 months, to about 7.5 as measured with the L Due to serious disease, I could not dilate for a while at about 8 month post op. It was not SRS related but really bad and I didn't have my mind on that. It was about 2 month stop. Hard to remember, it's a bad experience I try to forget I lost about 1 inch, and have since regained / relost/ regained some of that. Currently, at least on the S, I'm at 6.5, on the L I used to be at 6 but working up Then a few month ago I have lost the M dilator (yeah my bad, don't do drugs kids) making it tough to work with just S and L so I'm back to 5.5 on the L while still at 6.5 on the S I will try to get soulsource or something with E3 oil to go back to at least 6.5 on L"*

Apparently I should have posted on this ages ago? Silver nitrate certainly works for granulation tissue, but I think it is absolutely not the best option for post-op trans people. It stains the tissue and can leave semi-permanent "tattoos" it tends to spread beyond where you want it to go and can atrophy other tissue a little bit, and its only somewhat effective. Steroid injections are also commonly used for overly prolific granulation tissue, but once again, hard to keep where you put them and its easy to overshoot and cause atrophy. What would be a lot better would be a topical steroid, but in a wet area, creams/ointments just spread around like mad. There exists "triamcinolone dental paste". The stuff is hydroscopic and was designed to be placed in the mouth on apthous ulcerations (canker sores). As a result, you can take a little dab of this paste, and push it onto the cancer sore, and it rapidly absorbs water from the surrounding tissues and glues itself in place, eluting the steroid directly at the site of application but minimal exposure to the surrounding areas. As a result, I can take this stuff, and basically place it on undesirable granulation tissue, and literally within days, it begins to regress backwards due to its impact on the vascular proliferation. Once the granulation tissue becomes a regular old wound bed again, you just stop using it and hopefully things heal over right. If not, and it starts to come back, you just bonk it again with another coating once a day until you get where you need to be. This is far less irritating, seems to be extremely effective, and is highly precise. I couldn't find any evidence when I searched of this drug in studies or elsewhere being used in this fashion, and its exceptionally effective and in my opinion superior to that of other options. Sorry I didn't post on this one before, sometimes I do stuff and not really think about it being a big deal, but I've had a few of these in a row lately and the patients commented on how much more convenient/effective it was and I realized I should prob post it up."*

They cut off a piece when I was in the office but it didn't hurt at all, surprisingly.

### Pain

Pain is common in the weeks/months after surgery. A small percentage of women have severe pain for longer.

Possible reasons for pain include

* Everyone recovers at a different rate and has different experiences of pain. Even when everything is normal some people will have significant levels of pain for months while others have very little even while still in hospital.
* Pain in the weeks after surgey is common, and would likley be treated with drugs, potentially quite strong.
* Standard painkillers do not work for some people and they need to try alternatives. This can happen in hospital as well as afterwards. Some doctors are very poor at prescribing good painkillers (because of potential for abuse).
* Granulation, especially if its in a senstitve spot. This can last a long time and worst case may need revision.
* Scar contraction. This can last a long time and worst case may need revision.
* Sutures can be sharp and poke in sensitive spots.
* UTI's can be horribly painful. These need medical treatment. Standard tests do not show up all possible UTI's so a negative test does not necessarily mean you do not have one. Some UTI's will need different antibiotics.
* Infection.
* Recreational drug use can give a very high tolerance for painkillers (opiates) to the point they don't work and doctors are too scared to give you more. Worse, you may also have an increases sensitivty to pain.

### Sensation

It will likely take some time to regain the ability to orgasm after surgery, and permanent loss is rare. 3 months is far too early to worry, and it can take up to a year. Less common it takes longer than that. If you still have sensation to touch you're likley still ok.

Anti-depressants, finasteride, low testosterone can all cause problems. For some bioidentical progesterone can help with libedo.

Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific."*

## Regret

Be aware that there are some hate subs targeting transgender people on reddit by misrepresenting surgery, regret, and detransition. I've not linked to them as the discussion there is very misleading and quite disturbing. If you're not sure if you're looking at a hate sub go to [subredditstats.com](https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps/gendercritical) and look at how the users of the sub overlap with known hate subs like gendercritical, itsafetish, lgbdropthet, detrans, etc (don't go looking at those subs, you'll only get upset).

Regret is rare, but there are a few cases.

David Reimer

* https://wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer - *David Peter Reimer \(born Bruce Peter Reimer; 22 August 1965 – 4 May 2004\) was a Canadian man born male but reassigned as a girl and raised female following medical advice and intervention after his penis was accidentally destroyed during a botched circumcision in infancy.*
* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money - *"During his professional life, Money was respected as an expert on sexual behavior, especially known for his views that gender was learned rather than innate. However, it was later revealed that his most famous case of David Reimer was fundamentally flawed. ... During subsequent appointments with Reimer and Reimer's twin brother Brian, Money forced the two to rehearse sexual acts, with David playing the bottom role as his brother "[pressed] his crotch against" David's buttocks. Money also forced the two children to strip for "genital inspections", occasionally taking photos. Money justified these criminal acts by claiming that "childhood 'sexual rehearsal play'" was important for a "healthy adult gender identity"."*

&gt; Of the 3398 patients who had appointments during this period, 16 (0.47%) expressed transition-related regret or detransitioned. Of these 16, one patient expressed regret but was not considering detransitioning, two had expressed regret and were considering detransitioning, three had detransitioned, and ten had detransitioned temporarily. The reasons stated by patients for their regret or detransition included: social factors, reporting physical complications, and changing their mind about their gender identity and identifying as their gender assigned at birth. The 16 patients consisted of 11 trans women, two trans men, two cis men, and one person assigned male at birth who said their gender identity was “trans”.

Ignore the YouTube video on regret by the Russian propaganda channel "RT Documentary", for obvious reasons.
