Discovered a bunch of hair at the 5th month. 3 or 4 (of 4, 5 cms long) hairs, are coming out and show up out in the entrance. More deep, i can touch a bunch of them like forming some crusts. Started to bleed in every Dilation session after that. Im using pessaries or ovules. No gynecologist wanted to use speculum to see inside. Went to 4 or 5 in 6 months. Dr Javier Belinky said "this is weird, almost impossible to happen. Put some epilation creme. Or wait some more, let's see if they go away alone"."*

&gt; Plastic surgeon. City: Blumenau. Trained under Dr. Leis in Philadelphia. I have no first-hand accounts but from a TV show I watched recently, he's done very few vaginoplasties so far (~30). His clinic has an FFS surgeon as well. Vaginoplasty + hospital fees costs around BRL 35k. http://transgeneros.com.br/

&gt; Plastic surgeon. City: Rio de Janeiro and Lisbon/Portugal. Trained under Dr. João Décio Ferreira in Lisbon. He's renowned in trans surgeries in Brazil and frequently does reconstruction for botched/unsatisfactory procedures. His vaginoplasty technique uses a jejunum mucosa graft as vaginal lining, which reportedly doesn't smell like colon nor constantly lubricates like peritoneum (his patients confirm this in his facebook group). Another advantage mentioned is a shorter/easier dilation schedule. Does phallo/meto as well. Vaginoplasty + hospital fees costs around BRL 42k. https://www.marciolittleton.com/

&gt; Urologist. City: Porto Alegre. Trained under Dr. Walter Koff, one of the pioneers of SRS in Brazil. He's one of the surgeons that do vaginoplasty through the public health system, and has large mileage, claiming to have conducted over 200 surgeries in the past ten years. However his poor technique (no labia minora or clitoral hood) and awful bedside manners are often criticized, and there are a few horror stories confirmed. Unknown if he uses the same technique and manners for paying customers. Not recommended. http://prouro.com.br/home/
