There's not a lot of trans specific info on BA, so there's a fair amount of cis-female links here. Many of the surgeons that do BA also do hips/butt, so check there also.

In the late 90s he became famed as a man who would do anything to win a bet. His most famous wager was in 1996 when he agreed to receive breast implants and keep them for one year in return for US$100,000 \(US$160,000 in 2018\). The year passed and he won the bet but he became accustomed to the breasts and did not have them removed."*

Anatomical implants are said to produce a better aesthetic result compare to the traditional round implants. However implants can rotate, and when this happens with an anatomical it's not good.

# Fat Transfer

The limitations of breast fat transfer appear to be mainly in the size of the increase (typically about 1 cup per round of surgery), and that its yet a well established procedure and highly dependant on the surgeons expertise. There are very few surgeons who can sucessfully transfer a large amount of fat, and it may require more than one round of fat transfer.

Consider that many thousands of fat grafting to the breast procedures have been performed, all of which include fat grafting into the subcutaneous plane. Included in these numbers are over 6000 such operations by just three of the busiest breast fat
grafting surgeons in the world, yet it appears that there have been no published reported cases of fatal or nonfatal PFE from fat transplantation to the breast"*. The 3 busiest surgeons are

Dr Roger K. Khouri is very active in this area, publishing papers and founding the company Brava LLC to sell the Brava device that's used by some surgeons before breast fat transfer. While there is a conflict of interest here, there are papers supporting by others. The Brava device is/was US$2500.

# Suction Devices
 
These work by having suction cups over the breasts and have the appearance of being a scam. You'd think if they actually worked they would be very popular and well known instead of some fringe treatment. However I'm uncertain as there are medical research papers on these devices, some surgeons use the BRAVA device prior to fat transfer (which is a somewhat different application), and there are some seemingly credible posts/videos. It appears that it can work, but you have to be very dedicated to stick with it long enough and most women will give up first.

## Enhance Breast Enlargement System

https://enhancebreastenlargement.com/

These two YouTube videos discuss the Brava and [Enhance Breast Enlargement System](https://enhancebreastenlargement.com/). The Enhance product is US$315, but the breast cups appear to be the same as sold on the Chinese site [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com) for significantly less money (seach for "vacuum breast"). The key point to look for is the attachement for the tubing exiting the cup to the side, which seems more sensible that sticking directly out. A couple of examples are [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1-pair-breast-cupping-for-vacuum-therapy-machine-breast-sucking-machine-accessories-breast-enlargement-suction-cups/32745275581.html) and [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Plastic-Breasts-Lifting-Vacuum-Cup-Breat-Enlargement-Cupping-Tip-for-Breast-Lift-Machine-Sexy-Hip-Lift/32960804572.html).

## Australia

Lookup all Australian surgeons on the [Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency](https://www.ahpra.gov.au/registration/registers-of-practitioners.aspx) to see if they are registered to practice, and if they have been in any trouble.

**Cosmetic Surgeon vs Plastic Surgeon**

https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/guide-to-cosmetic-surgery - *"There is a significant difference between cosmetic surgeons and plastic surgeons. To become a plastic surgeon, a doctor must — after they qualify as a doctor — do at least another 5 years of training and study through the* ***Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS)*** to obtain a specialist qualification recognised by the Australian Government. By contrast, any doctor can call themselves a cosmetic surgeon — without any further training after their initial medical training or any specialist qualification. It is legal for any doctor to perform many cosmetic surgery procedures."*

I have massive issues with this job, I cannot walk without post OP bra (over 6 months now). I have booked a consultation with local plastic surgeon to look at it, I probably will need this corrected. My left armpit (look up in the text) is still not healed, it is better but not perfect. Often I get my arms numb, cannot sleep on my back without bra  support because both implants slide down to my sides and cause pain. Left implant is still causing nerve compression and pain. I do have as well disfiguration on the bottom of my boobs and it makes the entire thing looking disgusting, not like breasts at all."*

You will never be able to pay for your surgery.”"*
* [Neda / Dr Ergin](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/zy63qx/neda_dr_ergin/) by Pomshka in 2023 - *This post isn't about them, it's about Neda himself... He was always posting saying if anyone has any questions or concerns to not hesitate to contact him. So I did. I explained that my father had some reservations and could he, Neda offer me any words to ease my dad's thoughts? ... I did not expect for Neda to reply, saying that he had cancelled my surgery, blocked/banned me from the hospital and saying that "I had taken the space of some other Trans person who could have had their surgery earlier and that the bad karma was on me"... Luckily I could cancel my hotel reservation with no charges but unfortunately my flight tickets were not refundable. So I've lost £700.*
* [Transgender surgery by neda - my thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/yiyo1c/transgender_surgery_by_neda_my_thoughts/) in 2022 - *"The main problem is Neda himself. Once I got into the hospital room, he started telling me about other patients, there was no confidentiality... A few days after surgery, I woke up to my before and after photos posted to Instagram. I couldn’t believe he had actually posted them without asking me first... Not only this, but he can be rude over messages. One boy posted his experience on Facebook about how he was having some problems after his surgery, Neda told him to come back to the hospital for him to get checked out which resulted in the boy going back a few times through his stay. When it was time for his chest reveal, Neda was texting with another boy who had surgery around the same time and said the boy had been to the hospital 4 times and they don’t have time for his chest reveal as he and the doctor are “too busy”."*

Fix my Symmastia I contacted him online sent him pictures of everything. He told me not a problem. We set up an appointment for me to to see him. Everything was going fine till I told him that I was assigned the male gender at birth he didn't know till I brought it up. HE told me he runs a conservative practice he doesn't do anything crazy so he would no longer be able to preform the surgery on me. I asked him isn't surgery the same regardless,* ***Than he said with a stern voice that he does not do breast implants on MEN...*** *I was in shock, literally in tears. I traveled all around the unitied states interviewing with several of the top plastic surgeons never had an experience like this one.* ***He also had me banned on the Justimplant's forum that he runs.*** *Such a sad day, when discrimination hits you dead in the face. Sad thing is many transgender people have there rights taken away all the time. Im lucky that most people would never know unless I told him. However im glad he did not find out while I was on the operating table... the thought scares me till this day."*

* [PROMISE OF BEAUTY TURNS UGLY FOR SOME](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2004-03-07-0403070114-story.html) in 2004 - *"The Florida Board of Medicine has disciplined two of them -- center medical director Dr. Jeffrey C. Hamm and Dr. Timothy Alexander -- for misconduct. Both have been at the center since at least 1999. .. .Fort Lauderdale bartender James "Jamie" McCormick, 51, was found dead in his bed Nov. 14, a day after having a face-lift and chin implant by Alexander at the center. A friend drove him home after surgery, leaving him with painkillers and antibiotics. ... Adrianna Arroyo, 37, of Miami, almost died of kidney failure at Baptist Hospital in 1999 after a week of vomiting following a tummy tuck, breast implants and liposuction done on the same day by Alexander. She had called or visited him at least twice, complaining of weakness. ... Russo, 38, a mother of seven and pilot training to work for Southwest Airlines, said in her lawsuit that she lost enough breast tissue to infection and scarring that the center had to put in new implants. Several months after the initial surgery, she felt a stabbing pain in her chest. The implant had torn through the bottom of her right breast and was poking through a two-inch hole in her skin. Her pending lawsuit says Alexander overfilled the implants, making them too heavy for her damaged breast. ... His colleague, Alexander, has settled four suits filed since 2000. The state has sanctioned him three times. ... Neither Hamm nor Alexander carries medical malpractice insurance, state records show, frustrating some patients seeking compensation for injuries."*
