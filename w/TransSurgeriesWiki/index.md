# Introduction

These pages are a collection of links to to information about surgeons around the world. Originally it was only links containing photos of MTF SRS results based on my (HiddenStill) personal research into SRS, but has been expanded. **There's a wide range of information here and some of it may be disturbing.**

I've tried to avoid expressing my personal opinions on these pages but there is bias in what I've collected due to my interests at the time. I'm trying to round it out to include links of more general interest to everyone, but its a long term project. As a result **what you see here is not necessarily representative of what's available on Internet. Further, links posted here are not an endorsement that the surgeons are good, or even competent. Please bear that in mind and do your own research.**


Note that there's a fair number of negative posts about surgeons here as its one of the things I'm most interested in. All experienced surgeons have negative reviews and its not something that should rule automatically one out. I like to consider the number of negative vs positive reviews. There's also more links for some surgeons than others, partly due to my personal focus. I'll continue to edit and add to these pages over time and if anyone knows of any results, links, corrections, or improvements please let me know.

I generally only list posts or video's where I can identify the surgeon. Unfortunately a lot of YouTuber's don't mention their surgeons, or bury the information in their video's where I'm not inclined to find it. 

I normally add links in the wiki without asking permission, but if the original poster wants links removed from these pages please let me know. There was a complaint/discussion on this here on reddit, [My issue with the Transgender_Surgeries Wiki - and how I propose to solve this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/lvh35w/my_issue_with_the_transgender_surgeries_wiki_and/) in 2021

Many of the links should be explored further. For example, I list only one YouTube video rather than all of them by the same person.

Web pages in foreign languages can easily be translated using the Google Chrome browser.

This sub was created as the wiki for /r/Transgender_Surgeries. Having a separate sub allows the wiki to be made 18+ without making the parent sub 18+.

## Help Improve The Wiki

Please help add to this collection of information. It benefits all of us.

I usually see most trans related posts, but please also

* reply to one of my posts/comments
* just type /u/HiddenStill in a post/comment
* pm me (however I prefer to have information public so I can link to it).

## About Me

There's nothing much I want to say. My username /u/HiddenStill was chosen because I'd spent years trying not to transition. Its made me overly cautious, to the point where I say very little about myself and I especially don't like talking about anything recent. It probably doesn't really matter, but its not entirely rational anymore.

When I started out on reddit I used to post my opinions on surgeons just like anyone else, but I've pulled back from that and mostly stopped. This wiki and moderating has given me more attention and influence than I'm comfortable with, and I don't think its fair for me to influence anyone's choice in surgeon beyond providing links to resources. For all these reasons if/when I have surgery I'm not going to post about it under this account.

I go by female pronouns online and male in real life.

I'm not and never have been in any medical field. My work is far removed from that.

# Choosing a surgeon

Women have many varied reasons for choosing their surgeon andprioritise different things. These include

* Cost/Insurance
* Aesthetic and functional results
* Risk and severity of complications
* Post-op support by surgeon
* Similarity of end result to natal female
* Close to home
* Feel safer in their own country, fear of travel, lack of trust in foreign surgeons
* Ability to sue doctors for bad results
* Friends reccomendations
* Availablity of support, friends, family
* Surgical technique
* Depth or width
* Wait list
* Surgeons experience
* Eligibility for surgery (BMI, age, etc)
* Combining SRS with other procedures (eg FFS or BA)
* Hair removal not required (look at the hair removal wiki page to see what this actually means)
* Surgeon is trans (in the USA, Marci Bowers, Christine McGinn,  Ellie Zara Ley, Gregory Dowbak (BBL in Florida))

If you have freedom to choose a surgeon it can be difficult to get started evaluatining them due to the amount of choice. Personally I'd start by looking at the most popular surgeons as judged by the number of reviews in the wiki - they are presumaby popular for a reason and the number of reviews make it easier to judge the risk of having problems. ie no botched surgeries for a surgeon with no reviews doesn't mean anything, except that a surgeon with no reviews probably doesn't have much practice/skill either. Look at photos of results very carefully and educate yourself on what you are looking at - you may find you have different opinions on what is good/bad to others.

Some are looking for the best surgeon in the world, money no object. Its not an easy question to answer - I've noticed a number of exceptionally wealthy trans women all choosing different surgeons. I'd start looking at surgeon in the USA and Thailand, starting with the most popular.


Some prefer surgeons in their own country so that its easier to get problems taken care of. This post mentions local surgery in both Sweden and Germany and still having problems getting doctors to help.

I'm not aware of anyone who's sucessfully sued a surgeon for botched trans surgery anywhere in the world.

Surgeons have different eligibility requirements for surgery. Some (many) will not perform surgery under 18. In Thailand it is not legal to perform surgery under 18, and parental permission is required under 20. There's a wide variation in health/weight (BMI).

### Choosing a new surgeon

And by new I mean inexperienced at this particular surgery.

The 2020 paper [Adverse events associated with gender affirming vaginoplasty surgery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446999/) by Cecile A Ferrando studied complications by a new surgeon and concluded

&gt; The incidence of serious adverse events related to vaginoplasty surgery is low, whereas minor events are common. *After a threshold of 50 vaginoplasty surgeries, these events were reduced, including the need for revision surgery.*


*This is my opinion for what it's worth.*

There's many new trans surgeons appearing in recent years. You might reasonably think that all surgeons are highly qualified professionals who are all much the same, and none of them could possibly be incompetant. After all, even the best surgeons in the world were once inexperienced and unknown. And even the best still have reports of botched surgeries So what if you choose one of these?

You may have little choice due to insurance, or perhaps they are close to your home and you value that. Still, I think its worth understanding the risks.

There's two main issues.

* Going by the (many) reviews I've read surgeons get better as they get more experience. i.e. less complications. That makes sense. If that's true then obviously a new surgeon will be worse, and you're more likley to have complications. When then do they get as good as they are ever going to be? I've no idea, but I'd guess it's before you'll find a reasonable number of reviews.
* You won't be able to find many reviews of the surgeon, and perhaps none at all. This is fundamentally important as not all surgeons are equal and some are frankly terrible. Which one is yours? If the surgeon has a botched surgery rate of 10%, and you mange to find 5 reviews there's every chance you'll never know. Even 20 reviews is not a great number. For a new surgeon you're not going to find 5 reviews. And even if its not totally botched, is it the result you're looking for?

Some complications are minor and easily rectified. Others will will be a traumatic journey over many years and multiple surgeons, and some appear to be hopeless. I would suggest you want to reduce the chance of this ever happening. You may not get it to zero as even the most well regarded surgons have cases, but you can reduce it.

After a threshold of 50 vaginoplasty surgeries, these events were reduced, including the need for revision surgery."*. Note that this is a single surgeon, a small sample, and still only 76 surgeries. There's are surgeons who have 1000 cases, and a few with over 2000.

If you search for the surgeons name together with the keywords malpractice, lawsuit, etc, and find lots of hits of the surgeons own site it may indicate the surgeon is trying to hide something, so keep looking. See this post

* From LinkedIn - [Dealing with Negative Search Results: How to Get Rid of the Bad Stuff](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dealing-negative-search-results-how-get-rid-bad-stuff-joe-chierotti/) - Suppress (or Bury) the Negative Content with Reverse SEO. Your other option for minimizing the reputation damage of negative content is with search engine suppression, also referred to as Reverse SEO. This is akin to fighting fire with fire. Instead of trying to remove content, you simply create more in an effort to bury the negative content in the search results. In most cases, suppression via Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - i.e. Reverse SEO - is not only effective at removing negative content from the first few pages of search results, but it also works to strengthen your online branding and/or promote your business in a positive light. Most consumers will only visit the first few links returned in search results. As you create SEO-focused content, your page rises to the top of the search ranks, while other pages move down. If you can get the negative content pushed to the third or fourth page, it's likely that consumers won't even see it."

## Bias on Review Sites

There are several major sources of information on transgender surgery

* reddit - reddit doesn't appear to have any significant bias, except for the bias inherent selection bias of being on reddit in the fist place
* Facebook - significant bias due to promotion by surgeons &amp; medical tourism companies. See above.
* [Susans](https://www.susans.org/) - often removes or edits posts critical of surgeons, unfortunately introducing significant bias. Note that susans appears have significantly less traffic in recent years than it did in the past and is rapidly becoming irrelevant as a source of information. There's some discussion in this post [PSA: susans.org is not a trustworthy site for information on surgeons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fvxjdi/psa_susansorg_is_not_a_trustworthy_site_for/) in 2020, see also reply to [What proportion of MTF SRS is “successful”?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ihabkt/what_proportion_of_mtf_srs_is_successful/g32ossr/?context=3) in 2020.

Miami Herald in 2016 [State moves to revoke license of Miami 'butt lift' surgeon accused of medical malpractice](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article66376602.html) - *"Florida health officials this week took steps to revoke the medical license of a Miami cosmetic surgeon accused of severely injuring at least four patients in May 2015 while performing liposuction and another procedure known as a “Brazilian butt lift."* ***and*** *"The Miami Herald contacted the women after they posted comments about the doctor on a cosmetic surgery referral website called RealSelf.com, where Omulepu has received high ratings."*

Given that, I'd be concerned if there were a large discrepancy between the number or quality of reviews on a site like realself and susans/reddit. Some surgeons have a lot of self created material but very few independent reviews, which also concerns me.

I'd also be cautious where surgeons feature in articles in lots of magazines, newspapers and social media. There's a risk that they are really good at marketing and their reputation is influenced by that rather than their skills.

# Malpractice Insurance in the USA

A number of states do not require doctors to carry malpractice insurance, and some of the surgeons listed in this wiki do not have it (I've not checked all of them).

* https://www.gallaghermalpractice.com/blog/post/going-bare-are-doctors-required-to-have-malpractice-insurance - *"Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia."*

Why doesn't a doctor carry malpractice insurance?

* http://www.kaplanlegal.com/hidden-danger-uninsured-doctors/ - *"Most attorneys will not take on a medical malpractice case if it is known that the doctor is uninsured because even if the patient is successful, it may be difficult if not impossible to collect."*
* https://www.realself.com/question/michigan-mi-concern-doctor-medical-malpractice-insurance-red-flag
* https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Does-Your-Dr-Have-Malpractice-Insurance-Maybe-Not--382113561.html


The huffpost article [Patients, Beware When Doctors 'Go Bare'](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/medical-malpractice-insurance_b_2455946) from 2013 makes some very clear points   

* *Often, this means that a patient killed or injured by a careless, uninsured physician could potentially be left with little or no compensation for their damages, medical bills and lost wages.*

* *Virtually every lawyer who sues doctors in Florida takes the case on a contingency fee basis, in my experience. That means they will only get paid if and when the case resolves. It also means that the lawyer is responsible for fronting the costs of the investigation and trial. Because uninsured doctors are undesirable defendants for most personal injury lawyers, when any Florida medical malpractice lawyer investigates a potential claim, one of the first questions asked is, "Does the doctor have malpractice insurance?"*
* *In addition to the sign, uninsured doctors have to obtain an irrevocable line of credit to pay a malpractice claim. The line must be made payable to the doctor upon presentation of a final judgment or settlement. The funds cannot be used for litigation costs or defense attorney's fee."
* *Doctors who do not operate or have staff privileges are only required to maintain a line of credit equal to $100,000 per claim or $300,000 per incident. Doctors who operate or have hospital privileges must have a line of $250,000 or $750,000 per incident.*

## Florida

Many doctors in Florida do not carry malpractice insurance. Doctors that do not have malpractice insurance must legally display this notice

&gt; I have elected not to carry medical malpractice insurance however, I agree to satisfy any adverse judgments up to the minimum amounts pursuant to s. 458.320(5) (g)1, F. S. I understand that I must either post notice in a sign prominently displayed in my reception area or provide a written statement to any person to whom medical services are being provided that I have decided not to carry medical malpractice insurance. I understand that such a sign or notice must contain the wording specified in s. 458.320(5) (g), F.S. 

A quick way to find if a surgeon does not have malpractice insurance is to search for their name and in quotes "DECIDED NOT TO CARRY MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE", or search this site and look under the "Financial Responsibility" tab of the doctors "Practitioner Profile".

* https://appsmqa.doh.state.fl.us/MQASearchServices/Home

There's probably a lot more than this, but I stopped looking. I'd guess there are far larger numbers of serious complications that are not reported in the news.

# Order of Surgeries

This discussion ignores money/insurance requirements.

Most surgeons follow the [WPATH Standards of Care](w/TransSurgeriesWiki/index#wiki_wpath_standards_of_care) and it is very difficult to get genital surgery without being on HRT and socially transitioned for at least 12 months (some of this has changed with the new [SOC 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/xfanwx/wpath_standards_of_care_version_8_published/)). Two psychiatrist letters are also required by WPATH rules. It is possible to get SRS without social transition, but probably not worth the effort if you intend to transition anytime soon. Getting SRS without HRT is more difficult, but can be done in some circumstances - if you do that you will need to go on either estrogen or testosterone afterwards to prevent serious medical problems occurring.

After SRS you have to dilate regularly, so it may be best to leave a (long) gap before other surgeries that could interfere with that schedule. Genital hair removal for SRS should be started at least a year prior to surgery, and probably more. It needs to remain clear for the entire hair growth cycle to be sure its all gone. Any remaining hair may be impossible to remove post-op. There's little research on this, but I would think electrolsys is safer option than laser for genital hair - for face it doesn't matter much of some grows back. Surgeons should be able to provide you with a drawing of the area that needs hair removal. If you remove all the hair then you won't be able to hide surgical scars post-op, should you have them. If the the surgeon says you don't need hair removal for penile inversion becaue they do it during surgery, its not true - it's not guarenteed and you are at risk if internal hair.  Its more correct to say that they don't need it, but you do (ie its your problem not theirs).

FFS is not gatekept by WPATH and can be done anytime, including before HRT, but it is usually reccomended to wait for a year or two of HRT so its more clear what is required. You might find you don't want certain FFS procedures after having been on HRT for a while. Having said that, most FFS procedures are bonework which does not change on HRT, so you can choose to do it anytime. If you have FFS before facial hair removal you're likely find you won't pass until you get rid of the hair.

Breast augmentation requires one psychiatrist letter according to WPATH, but I don't think all surgeons follow that rule. You should not have BA until you have been on HRT for a while and had whatever breast growth you're going to get, otherwise augmentation can cause deformity and/or excess size. Its best not to have BA until you've been on HRT for some years as it can otherwise lead to deformity.

Ideally VFS is the last procedure under general anesthetic as intubation can damage the results of VFS, even with an experienced anesthetist. You should try voice training before voice surgery as it gives good results for many and you'll need to train your voice afterwards anyway. Also less risk (although I think it is possible to damage your voice by incorrect training).

Hair transplants should be done after (or during) FFS, not before, and not soon afterwards. FFS can shift your hairline so if do it before you may need to do it again anyway. Facial Team do a coronal incision and use hair that from the section of the scalp that would be discarded reducing wastage of hair folicles (maybe others do as well, I don't know).

Not sure, but I believe FFS can shift the eyebrows so any permanent eyebrow shaping before FFS could cause problems.

Facial and body hair removal with laser/electrolysis can be done at any time, including before/after HRT has started. Facial hair removal should generally be started as soon as possible as it takes a very long time to complete (mininum of a year due to hair growth cycle). Facial hair removal after social transition is difficult to deal with as you need to grow the hair out for a few days for electrolysis. Body hair will reduce on HRT, and even further if and when testicles are removed. Body hair removal may not be neessary. Body hair is usually removed with laser, not electrolysis. Facial hair is usually removed with laser first then electrolysis for anything thats's left. Electrolysis is more effective, but its also *very* expensive, slow, and painful.

Don't get face/body piercings soon before surgery as they must be removed due to the electrocautery equipment used. Surgeons will generally insist they be removed. If you do have piecings and cannot remove them for long find an non-metallic keeper for the surgery.

# Making Useful Surgery Posts

If you're making a post on reddit or elsewhere it would help if you did these things

* Give the name of the name of the surgeon, and if its someone who's not well known provide enough information that its easy to find them. I generally won't list them in this wiki without knowing who they are. If its on YouTube make it in the text so its easy to find without watching the entire video.
* Photo posts on [imgur](https://imgur.com/) should ideally have captions with the name of the surgeon, year of surgery, time post-op (days, weeks, etc), and any interesting points about the photo that the view should take note of. Not everyone will see the photo from a link on reddit. This post [Hana's Recovery (up to 6 months)](https://imgur.com/a/BmG49) shows an example of captions, but who is the surgeon and what year was it? The year is important because an older photo may not be representative of the surgeons current skill or technique. Imgur has recently started requiring login to view NSFW photos so its not ideal for this purpose, but I don't know whats better at this point.
* If you make multiple related posts add a link back to the older posts so that people can easily go back to them. Edit the posts in the older ones to refer forwards to the next. An index would be even better. Some people don't know how to use reddit and find related posts, and even if you do it can be very difficult after a few years and thousands of posts.
* Let me know if you make or see a post that you think should be in the wiki - I don't find all of them by myself. I normally link posts that I think will be of interest to people researching a surgeon. Either send me a pm or add my reddit user name to the post somewhere - i.e. just type \/u\/HiddenStill\/

*There's a new way of making image galleries on reddit that should probably superceed imgur etc. Its not yet enabled on the surgery sub (16 July 2020), but should be shortly. Its described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hisodw/image_gallery_support_is_coming_soon/)*

Questions that tend to be of interest to others include

* Pictures?
* Who was the surgeon?
* Why did you choose them?
* Would you recommend them to others?
* What did it cost? If insurance was used what company?
* How long was the wait list?
* How was the pain?
* Any complications?
* How does it look?
* For SRS, what was your depth?
* For SRS with surgeons that are not well known, how many surgeries have they done? Its interesting as there's a higher complication rate associated with less experience.
* What would you like to have known before having surgery?
* How is sensation?

It can be helpful to know how to format posts on reddit to make it easier to read.

* https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/faq/formatting_guide
* https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/

Here's a really good example of post of the above suggestions

* reddit [GRS/SRS Surgery 4th April 2019 Mr Roland Morley Charing Cross Hospital [UK]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/c0qnt5/grssrs_surgery_4th_april_2019_mr_roland_morley/) by Koukalaka in 2019

If you make a very negative post about a surgeon on susans.org there's a good chance it will get removed.

## Linking a series of posts

If you make a series of posts it helpful to link each post to the next and previous post in the series so that people can mroe easily explore them. This is especially important if you have made a large number of posts as it can be very tedious navigating the post history.

You can add these links after posting. In old reddit below the text box of the post there's an 'edit' link, and in the new reddit redesign there's "..." and "Edit Post".

Place a link in the text using something like

    [previous post](https://reddit.com)

## Requests for help with choosing FFS procedures

Many people are posting here asking for help choosing FFS procedures. If you don't post a proper set of photos you're not going to get very helpful feedback. Please remember that they are not glamour shots, they are supposed to show your 'defects'.

Rather than try to explain what photos are needed I'll link to a couple of resources as they are far better than anything I could write (also copyright, so that's awkward). I've been a bit reluctant to recommend these as they are both advertising commercial services and work together on occasion, but they are the best/only resources on this topic I'm aware of.

* http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/What_to_Send_Me.html
* YouTube [Photos for FFS Surgery consultation - 5 tips! | FAQ Tutorials in facial feminization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CZh3lWmrNw) by Facialteam

The [virtualffs]( http://www.virtualffs.co.uk) site also has a [good overview](http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/In_a_Nutshell.html) of facial gender differences so its worth reading that before posting.

# Fear

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_medical_procedures - *"Most people have a fear of medical procedures at some point in their lifetime, which can include the fear of surgery, dental work, doctors, or needles.

Of the patients studied, 33% developed a contact dermatitis to the vitamin E. Therefore we conclude that use of topical vitamin E on surgical wounds should be discouraged.*

Vitamin E is the main lipid-soluble antioxidant in the skin. Several anecdotal reports have suggested that topical use of vitamin E cream can reduce scar formation. Current evidence from the literature, however, does not support that proposition. In fact, studies report some adverse effects with use of vitamin E. Further research is needed before application of vitamin E cream becomes the standard of care."*

Thus, most corticosteroids are diluted prior to injection to minimize patient discomfort. Saline is an excellent diluent for all corticosteroids, but some physicians prefer to dilute with the local anesthetic lidocaine. A study comparing saline and unbuffered lidocaine as diluents, however, found no significant difference in discomfort between the two. It is possible that the anesthetic effect of lidocaine was offset by its acidity, which in itself causes burning upon injection; lidocaine buffered with bicarbonate does diminish the pain of injection"*

### Verteporfin

Verteporfin might prevent any scar formation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verteporfin - *"Verteporfin is an inhibitor of fibrosis in patients with persistent cholestasis. Verteporfin displays a wide spectrum of anti-fibrotic properties. Verteporfin prevents fibrosis in several human organs. Research has highlighted that verteporfin decreased expression of fibrotic genes in fibroblasts collected from nodules of patients suffering from Dupuytren's contracture. In 2018 information revealed verteporfin stopped fibrosis in the lung. Verteporfin is a marketed drug with a good safety profile. Verteporfin has also been used off-label. In 2021, scientists tested verteporfin to reveal if the drug would prevent scar tissue in skin. Testing of verteporfin on humans cleft lips will occur in 2021."*

**Dr. Barry Eppley Vs Lucille Iacovelli**

This 2010 case is interesting. Dr Eppley appears to have won this lawsuit.

&gt; ... Dr. Barry Eppley is a citizen of Indiana who has a medical practice in central Indiana. Lucille Iacovelli is a former patient of Dr. Eppley’s and a citizen of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Invoking both the court’s diversity and federal question jurisdiction, and seeking both injunctive relief and damages, Dr. Eppley has sued Ms. Iacovelli for defamation, tr ade disparagement, harassment, false-light publicity, and violation of § 43 of t he Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, through her allegedly false designation and description of fact. 

&gt; In 2001, Dr. Eppley performed a revisional facelift procedure on Ms. Iacovelli, a Massachusetts resident.

&gt; ... For approximately a year following the surgery, Dr. Eppley attempted to address Ms. Iacovelli’s concerns. They communicated by telephone, mail, and e-mail during that time. Ms. Iacovelli sent Dr. E ppley numerous e-mails complaining about her surgery and characterizing him as a butcher or murderer. Sometimes using aliases, she would send him e-mails on a daily basis. Ms. Iacovelli has never filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Eppley based on any of these complaints.
    
&gt; ... Since the surgery, Ms. Iacovelli has published a large volume of postings on various internet sites alleging that Dr . Eppley mishandled her surgery and caused her to suffer severe health problems, parti cularly breathing difficulties. She placed postings on complaint sites, maintained various blogs and websites, and posted videos on internet platforms, all blaming Dr. Eppley for her asserted post-surgical condition. In her internet publications, Ms. Iacovelli has noted that subsequent to the surgery performed by Dr. Eppley she consulted ot her physicians, who have concluded there was nothing physically wrong with her

# Medical Guidlines

Its important to read and understand these guidelines as most medical practiioners follow them, or pretend to.

DSM5 diagnoses you with gender dysphoria (ie if you're transgender or not), and WPATH Standands of Care outline how you will be treated by the medical profession if you are transgender.

Useful links

* https://www.florenceashley.com/academic-publications.html

## Informed Consent

Informed consent is a standard medical practice not limited to transgender care. Everyone who recieves any kind of medical treatment should understand the consequences of the treament (be informed) and give consent to that treatment. Transgender people however are "special" and we have a bunch of extra rules (see WPATH SOC) because we're assume to be not able to make our own decisions. Notice how cosmetic surgeries for example don't require psych letters.

If you appear unable to consent, or the doctor is not sure, then you're likley to be sent to get approval from a psychaitrist. This might be a problem if you're unable to communicate normally with the doctor - if you have austism for example. In this case the purpose is still consent, but from someone who is capable of evaluating you. It's not informed consent if you are asked to undergo therapy, and probably not if it requires lots of sessions with a psych or therapist. If you have no idea what you're doing or the consequences of HRT/transition you might also fail the informed part of informed consent, but chances are you're not reading this in that case. Usually a doctor would explain this all to you anyway, but I think its best not to appear uninformed (plus transition is lifechanging so you should be informed).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent - *"Informed consent is a process for getting permission before conducting a health care intervention on a person... A health care provider may ask a patient to consent to receive therapy before providing ... Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of medical ethics and research ethics. ... Informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as post-traumatic stress disorder or a severe intellectual disability, severe mental disorder, intoxication, severe sleep deprivation, Alzheimer's disease, or being in a coma."*

The individual criteria in the WPATH Standards Of Care that cover informed consent state *"Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to give consent for treatment"*

Access to informed consent for HRT depends very much on where you live. In some places its common, others not. Informed consent for MTF bottom surgery is very rare and I'm only aware of two surgeons who do it (see the SRS introduction page).

In the USA medical insurance may require psych letters, but this is a different issue.

https://thegalap.org/ - *"The GALAP Movement. We are a group of transgender, nonbinary, and allied mental health clinicians in the U.S. who believe in improving access to letters for clients who are seeking gender-affirming medical care. We resist the harmful practices of gatekeeping and believe in an* ***informed consent*** *model where clients can affirm their gender identity without the steep cost of sessions with mental health professionals and reductionist clinical practices. As such, we want to create a movement towards to providing free and low-cost letters for gender affirming access to medical care."*

**Minors**

Minors face extra problems with medical care, and worse if they are transgender minors as depending on age they are generally assumed to be incapable of informed consent.

The Australian [transhub](https://www.transhub.org.au/under-18s) site has a good explanation for the State of NSW.

&gt; There are three legally defined developmental stages for a young person’s ability to consent to medical care.

&gt; *  Young children, who are unable to consent

&gt; * Young people who are under 16, but Gillick Competent

&gt; *Young people who are between 16 and 18, who are able to consent as an adult

&gt; *Gillick Competence* is a legal state where a person under 16 years old is considered to have “the degree of maturity and intelligence needed” to consent to a treatment2. It changes depending on the nature of the medical decision, e.g. A different level of competence would be needed for having a small cut dressed compared to being prescribed a contraceptive medication. Being assessed as Gillick Competent can take some time, and it’s a process doctors need to take very seriously. Parents generally hold responsibility for their children until the age of 18, however children gain the ability to independently consent gradually depending on Gillick Competence. This is individualised and determined on a case-by-case basis i.e there is no hard and fast rule on what reaching competence looks like. It’s not quite as simple as one day someone being not Gillick Competent, and the next day they are."*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillick_competence - *"Gillick competence is a term originating in England and Wales and is used in medical law to decide whether a child (under 16 years of age) is able to consent to their own medical treatment, without the need for parental permission or knowledge."*

## Gatekeeping

While Australia and NSW specific, this page (and site) is worth reading in its entirety.

https://www.transhub.org.au/gatekeeping - *"For trans and gender diverse people, medical gender affirmation almost always requires interaction with some kind of health professional or medical body. When a health professional uses a model of informed consent, and takes a patient-led approach to facilitating medical affirmation, there is a balance of medical care and oversight, with patient needs, wishes, and hopes. Gatekeeping happens when health professionals place unnecessary and unfair hurdles in the path of affirmative care, and require trans and gender diverse patients to prove who we are and that we really want or need access to medically affirming care."*

* [Gatekeeping hormone replacement therapy for transgender patients is dehumanising](https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2018-105293) - *"Although informed consent models for prescribing hormone replacement therapy are becoming increasingly prevalent, many physicians continue to require an assessment and referral letter from a mental health professional prior to prescription. Drawing on personal and communal experience, the author argues that assessment and referral requirements are dehumanising and unethical, foregrounding the ways in which these requirements evidence a mistrust of trans people, suppress the diversity of their experiences and sustain an unjustified double standard in contrast to other forms of clinical care. Physicians should abandon this unethical requirement in favour of an informed consent approach to transgender care."*

There's a good discussion of therapists red flags on susans.org that relate to gatekeeping

In contrast for cosmetic surgery in the cis gender population the standards are different and gate-keeping practically non-existent.

* 2007 - [Excess mortality from suicide and other external causes of death among women with cosmetic breast implants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17667401/) - *"An increased rate of suicide among women with cosmetic breast implants has been consistently reported in the epidemiologic literature... Among women with implants, we observed statistically significant 3-fold excesses of suicide... Thus, screening for pre-implant psychiatric morbidity and post-implant monitoring among women seeking cosmetic breast implants may be warranted."*

&amp;nbsp;
## Conversion Therapy

Conversion therapy is a horrific practice with serious long term consequences, including suicide

* https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy - *"So-called “conversion therapy,” sometimes known as “reparative therapy,” is a range of dangerous and discredited practices that falsely claim to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. Such practices have been rejected by every mainstream medical and mental health organization for decades, but due to continuing discrimination and societal bias against LGBTQ people, some practitioners continue to conduct conversion therapy. Minors are especially vulnerable, and conversion therapy can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide."*

&amp;nbsp;
## DSM5

The DSM-5 is the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5) contains a section on the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria. If you don't meet these criteria you could have great difficult getting HRT/surgery.

There's an update to the DSM4 due in March 2022

* [Updated DSM-5 Text Revisions to Be Released in March](https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.pn.2022.1.20) in psychiatryonline.org - *"There have also been significant updates to the terminology to describe gender dysphoria. The term “desired gender” is now “experienced gender,” the term “cross-sex medical procedure” is now “gender-affirming medical procedure,” and the term “natal male”/“natal female” is now “individual assigned male/female at birth.”"*

See [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria), and I've copied out the relevant parts (also see the DSM 5 page 452).

&gt; The DSM-5 defines ***gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults*** as a marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and their assigned gender, lasting at least *6 months*, as manifested by *at least two of the following:*

&gt; * A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics)

&gt; * A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics)

&gt; * A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender

&gt; * A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

&gt; * A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

&gt; * A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

&gt; In order to meet criteria for the diagnosis, the condition must also be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

The DSM-5 defines ***gender dysphoria in children*** as a marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, *lasting at least 6 months,* as manifested by *at least six of the following (one of which must be the first criterion):*

&gt; * A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

&gt; * In boys (assigned gender), a strong preference for cross-dressing or simulating female attire; or in girls (assigned gender), a strong preference for wearing only typical masculine clothing and a strong resistance to the wearing of typical feminine clothing

&gt; * A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe play or fantasy play

&gt; * A strong preference for the toys, games or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other gender

&gt; * A strong preference for playmates of the other gender

&gt; * In boys (assigned gender), a strong rejection of typically masculine toys, games, and activities and a strong avoidance of rough-and-tumble play; or in girls (assigned gender), a strong rejection of typically feminine toys, games, and activities

&gt; * A strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy

&gt; * A strong desire for the physical sex characteristics that match one’s experienced gender

&gt; As with the diagnostic criteria for adolescents and adults, the condition must also be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.


### Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnosis is a medical term, whicish is [defined by wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis) as *"In healthcare, a differential diagnosis (abbreviated DDx) is a method of analysis of a patient's history and physical examination to arrive at the correct diagnosis. It involves distinguishing a particular disease or condition from others that present with similar clinical features."*

If you have any of these conditions you may have great difficulty getting HRT/surgery.

See the DSM-5, page 458, [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/q9tm1m/what_is_differential_diagnosis_of_gender_dysphoria/hgyi9ow/).

&gt; **Nonconfonnity to gender roles**. Gender dysphoria should be distinguished from simple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of another gender than the assigned one and by the extent and pervasiveness of gender-variant activities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to merely describe nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., "tomboyism" in girls, "girly-boy" behavior in boys, occasional cross-dressing in adult men). Given the increased openness of atypical gender expressions by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it is important that the clinical diagnosis be limited to those individuals whose distress and impairment meet the specified criteria.

&gt; **Transvestic disorder.** Transvestic disorder occurs in heterosexual (or bisexual) adolescent and adult males (rarely in females) for whom cross-dressing behavior generates sexual excitement and causes distress and/or impairment without drawing their primary gender into question. It is occasionally accompanied by gender dysphoria. An individual with transvestic disorder who also has clinically significant gender dysphoria can be given both diagnoses. In many cases of late-onset gender dysphoria in gynephilic natal males, transvestic behavior with sexual excitement is a precursor.

&gt; **Body dysmorphic disorder.** An individual with body dysmorphic disorder focuses on the alteration or removal of a specific body part because it is perceived as abnormally formed, not because it represents a repudiated assigned gender. When an individual's presentation meets criteria for both gender dysphoria and body dysmorphic disorder, both diagnoses can be given. Individuals wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed by some body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more "complete" usually do not wish to change gender, but rather desire to live as an amputee or a disabled person.

&gt; **Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders**. In schizophrenia, there may rarely be delusions of belonging to some other gender. In the absence of psychotic symptoms, insistence by an individual with gender dysphoria that he or she is of some other gender is not considered a delusion. Schizophrenia (or other psychotic disorders) and gender dysphoria may co-occur.

&gt; **Other clinical presentations**. Some individuals with an emasculinization desire who develop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity do have a presentation that meets criteria for gender dysphoria. However, some males seek castration and/or penectomy
for aesthetic reasons or to remove psychological effects of androgens without changing male identity; in these cases, the criteria for gender dysphoria are not met.

&amp;nbsp;
## ICD 11

The International Calssification of Diseases, maintained by the World Health Organisation, is an alternative to the DSM 5. It doesn't seem to be used much in trans health.

### ICD 10

ICD 10 is the prior version of ICD11

* https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en

[F64.0](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/F64) has the relevant diagnosis for "Transsexualism"

&gt; A desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of, one's anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one's body as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex.

### Version 7 Psych letters for Chest/Breast Augmentation

From page 105

&gt; **Criteria for Breast/Chest Surgery (One Referral)**

&gt; **Mastectomy** and Creation of a Male Chest in FtM Patients:

&gt; 1. Persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria;

&gt; 2. Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to give consent for treatment;

&gt; 3. Age of majority in a given country (if younger, follow the SOC for children and adolescents);

&gt; 4. If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled.

&gt; Hormone therapy is not a prerequisite.


&gt; **Breast Augmentation** (Implants/Lipofilling) in MtF Patients:

&gt; 1. Persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria;

&gt; 2. Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to give consent for treatment;

&gt; 3. Age of majority in a given country (if younger, follow the SOC for children and adolescents);

&gt; 4. If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled. Although not an explicit criterion, it is recommended that MtF patients undergo feminizing hormone therapy (minimum  12  months)  prior to breast augmentation  surgery. The purpose is to maximize breast growth in order to obtain better surgical (aesthetic) results.


### Version 7 Psych letters for Genital Surgery

From page 105-106

&gt; **Criteria for Genital Surgery (Two Referrals)**

&gt; **Hysterectomy and Salpingo-Oophorectomy** in FtM Patients and **Orchiectomy** in MtF Patients: 

&gt; 1. Persistent, well documented gender dysphoria;

&gt; 2. Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to give consent for treatment

&gt; 3. Age of majority in a given country;

&gt; 4. If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be well controlled;

&gt; 5. 12 continuous months of hormone therapy as appropriate to the patient’s gender goals (unless hormones are not clinically indicated for the individual).

&gt; 6. The aim of hormone therapy prior to gonadectomy is primarily to introduce a period of reversible estrogen or testosterone suppression, before a patient undergoes irreversible surgical intervention. These criteria do not apply to patients who are having these surgical procedures for medical indications other than gender dysphoria.

&gt; **Metoidioplasty or Phalloplasty** in FtM Patients and **Vaginoplasty** in MtF Patients:

&gt; 1. Persistent, well documented gender dysphoria;

&gt; 2. Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to give consent for treatment;

&gt; 3. Age of majority in a given country; 

&gt; 4. If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be well controlled;

&gt; 5. 12 continuous months of hormone therapy as appropriate to the patient’s gender goals (unless 
hormones are not clinically indicated for the individual);

&gt; 6. 12 continuous months of living in a gender role that is congruent with their gender identity. Although not an explicit criterion, it is recommended that these patients also have regular visits with a mental health or other medical professional.

&gt; The  criterion  noted  above  for  some  types  of  genital  surgeries—that  is, that patients engage in 12 continuous months of living in a gender role that is congruent with their gender identity—is based on expert clinical consensus that this experience provides ample opportunity for patients to experience and socially adjust in their desired gender role, before undergoing irreversible surgery.
