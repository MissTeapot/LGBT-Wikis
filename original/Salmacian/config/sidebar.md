# Rules
##1. Posts should be related to the Salmacian identity

This is a catch-all subreddit for salmacian stuff. Resources, memes, and serious conversation are all allowed. Talk of sex is acceptable, HOWEVER, this is not a pornographic subreddit. Exclusively pornographic material will be removed.

Pornographic material should be contained to /r/salmacianporn.

##2. Be respectful to others and their identities.

Nobody's identity is up for debate- Being Salmacian is not a gender or orientation, it can combine with any gender identity or sexual orientation. Be respectful of others, absolutely no gatekeeping identities.

## 3. Mark NSFW for images

Please mark images of naked bodies or exposed genitalia as NSFW.

## 4. No racism, ableism, sexism, homophobia, or transphobia.

We do not condone any kind of bigotry, slurs, or targeted harassment against any individual or group of people. Transmedicalism is Transphobia. Please report any post or comments containing hate speech.

## 5. Titles must be descriptive and helpful

Posting a single or 2 word title, or a title that contains no information as to what has been posted is unhelpful, and makes the subreddit hard to navigate. Please provide a title with a brief description.

## 6. Do not post a question until you have made sure it isn't answered in the FAQ

These questions have been answered many times. Yes, the surgery you want probably exists.

## 7. All Reddit sitewide rules apply

Failure to comply puts the whole subreddit at risk, so we will enforce these rules to protect other users.
