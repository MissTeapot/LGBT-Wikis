I got worried that I might end up the same way and sadly, my results aren't much different as you can see on the photos below... From the beginning till now, I manage to get in 7-8 cm in with a dilator. He said that I can expect maximum 9 cm depth, given the initial penis size of 14 cm erected... I am very bothered by the aesthetics - a huge penis-like clit, unhooded, a lot of hanging skin which is supposed to be the outer labiae, the vaginal opening looks like a separate entity, not being part of the vulva, and it's overall very asymetric - the entire clitoral structure is rotated to the right and the rest of the tissue follows it."*

These two papers have many authors, but since it is the "combined method" is seems likely that Schaff is the surgeon. I don't know for sure.

* [Komplikationen nach MtF-GaOp?](https://www.reddit.com/r/germantrans/comments/109k8pj/komplikationen_nach_mtfgaop/) by youraveragelinguist in 2023 - google translated *" I had my first GaOp at Schaff in Potsdam in 09/21. This went horribly wrong. Summary: rectovaginal fistula, complete side torn open, open bowel, neovagina was removed again. The torn intestinal wall was sewn up, with the result that anal sex is no longer possible because of the scar. After a year of rehab, then 11/22 next op at schaff, this time "successfully" with a full skin transplant. About 12cm long. Now the clue: the third operation is now 8 weeks ago and I'm really struggling with my neovagina: first unspeakable pain when bougien (but you all know that and it's normal), then inflammation, infections and finally a torn vaginal entrance. Despite all that, I bougied 4 times a day in tears and fainting because I never wanted to have my vagina taken from me again. Only to find out after 8 weeks that my neovagina has contracted extremely. It's only about as long as my middle finger, let it be 8 cm... I'll have a scar across my stomach and thighs for life and I'm not even sure if it will be worth it or if I'll need a fourth op. I can't imagine that 8cm can be satisfying. Since the failed first op, I can no longer have anal sex."*

I’m still pretty happy with the results because dilation is fairly easy and I have about 17+ cm of depth. I think Dr Schaff is a relatively good surgeon, but he needs to be paired with a good Gynecologist. My situation was not good with the fistula. However, the support of Dr Hertwig in Berlin. Made it bearable. I had an appointment everyweek to check how the healing process went. Now I’m eager to do the second operation to get the fistula fixed and the other tweaks that comes with the second op."*

He has great marketing and ive read people that are genuinely happy with their Mañero grs results, but the cases that go wrong are totally ignored by him and his team..."*

* **Doctor Fitness to Practise Details, The doctor has received the following warnings**, 19 Feb 2016 - 18 Feb 2021, *On five occasions in 2013 and 2014, Mr Christopher Inglefield failed to complete adequate surgical consent forms for a patient on whom he carried out a series of cosmetic breast procedures. He failed to record adequate details of the procedures on the consent forms and made written revisions on two of the consent forms that were not countersigned by the patient. This conduct does not meet with the standards required of a doctor. It risks bringing the profession into disrepute and it must not be repeated. The required standards are set out in Good Medical Practice and associated guidance. In this case, paragraph 17 of Good Medical Practice (2013) is particularly relevant: 17. You must be satisfied that you have consent or other valid authority before you carry out any examination or investigation, provide treatment or involve patients or volunteers in teaching or research. Whilst this failing in itself is not so serious as to require any restriction on his registration, it is necessary in response to issue this formal warning. This warning will be published on the List of Registered Medical Practitioners (LRMP) for a period of five years and will be disclosed to any person enquiring about his fitness to practise history. After five years, the warning will cease to be published on LRMP; however, it will be kept on record and disclosed to employers on request.*

Flash forward to 2019 I got a second opinion and then a surgery from Mr Bellringer - who was no better and did nothing other than give me an infection which required a trip to A&amp;E 2 days later... At the start of 2021, I decided to go private and try to fix the whole thing. After much back and forth with surgeons in Thailand and the UK, I chose Mr Inglefield and the LTC. I immediately felt seen and understood and he confirmed all the problems I felt I had and vowed to fix it. I paid just shy of 20k and the experience has been nothing short of abysmal. I’ve been lied to, gaslighted, and treated with nothing but utter contempt from this clinic. To cut a really long story short, nothing has changed - I’m still in the exact same position. Mr Inglefield never even attempted to remove the excess erectile tissue, and had the nerve to tell me it was never discussed. I left a detailed review on TrustPilot but the LTC has now flagged this for harmful or illegal content! LAUGHABLE."*
