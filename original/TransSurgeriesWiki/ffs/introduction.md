## Hairline

There's some argument about the height of the female hairline

On Deschamps-Braly's site [Debunking Three Common Myths About Female Hairlines](https://deschamps-braly.com/debunking-three-common-myths-about-female-hairlines/) by [Dr. Sara Wasserbauer](https://californiahairsurgeon.com/) we have 

&gt; There is a wealth of information—and misinformation—on the Internet about the female hairline, including shapes and heights. With this in mind, we want to demystify some common misconceptions and debunk popular myths to ensure that you have all of the information you need when considering any form of hairline surgery.

&gt; Myth #1: Female hairlines are naturally high. Really, the opposite is true. Draw an imaginary line between your brows, just above where the nosepiece of your sunglasses would rest. This anatomic landmark is known as the glabella. A male hairline will typically begin 6-8 cm above this, whereas a woman’s hairline will start at about 5.5 cm above the glabella.

On the other hand according to Facial Team [Hairline height in facial feminization](https://facialteam.eu/blog/ffs-surgery/feminine-hairline-ffs-guide/)

&gt; Hairline height, meaning the distance from the hairline to the brow, is somewhat controversial among today’s FFS surgeons. It used to be widely accepted that a female forehead is smaller than the male, and so common practice was to do a hairline advance procedure to bring it forward.

&gt; However, research by Alexandra Hamer of Virtual FFS shows that female hairlines are actually slightly higher, on average, than male hairlines that haven’t receded due to balding. Now, the top experts in the field of facial feminization surgery agree that most patients will not benefit from bringing the hairline forward. In fact, this procedure results in a scar along the hairline, and if it is made too low, it can actually make the face look even more masculine.

And Alexandra Hamer of [Virtual FFS](http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/Hair_and_Hairline.html) says in [Hair and Hairline](http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/Hair_and_Hairline.html)

&gt; Many FFS surgeons and patients believe that on average, women have lower hairlines in the middle than men but this is not actually true. In fact, women have higher hairlines in the middle than men (you can read more about this towards the bottom of the page under "Misconceptions").

Lowering the hairline will use an incision across the hairline potentially leaving a scar in a highly visible location. Hair transplants can be used to hide the scar if it is visible. Facial Team does a [coronal incision](https://facialteam.eu/blog/ffs-surgery/coronal-approach-in-ffs-surgery/) with the incision across the top of the head where its far less visible (optionally further back if there's not much hair up there).
