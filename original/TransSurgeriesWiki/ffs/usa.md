* [Frightening experience with Dr. Zukowski](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/13pwcrs/frightening_experience_with_dr_zukowski/) by birdsandsnakes in 2023 - *Yesterday, I went for high volume hair removal at the Cirine Hair Removal. They're associated with the Zukowski Center, and Dr Zukowski gives medical support — the deal is, he sedates you and gives you lidocaine injections to numb your face, and then they do a very long electrolysis session. I had a really scary experience. Shortly after my third set of lidocaine injections, I'd gone for a bathroom break, when suddenly I found myself disoriented, losing control of my limbs, having a hard time walking, seeing double, and struggling to put sentences together. I made it out of the bathroom and asked an electrologist to call 911 — I could no longer use my phone to do it myself — but they refused. Instead, they called Dr Zukowski back. He tried to convince me I was having a panic attack. (I've had panic attacks. This was not a panic attack.) At this point, my arms and legs were twitching uncontrollably, and I couldn't stand or walk without help. He insisted that this was my fault, and that I'd feel better if I relaxed. Eventually, he gave me some kind of intravenous medication that stopped the attack. I've since learned that those were [symptoms of a lidocaine overdose, which could have progressed to seizures or coma](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lidocaine-overdose).*
* [Consultation with Dr. Zukowski](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/uu4d6q/consultation_with_dr_zukowski/) by xyewwx in 2022, also see [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/uu4d6q/consultation_with_dr_zukowski/i9d1qkj/) - *"I have an absolute horror story working with him. I had his 7 hour electrolosis session done and during the procedure he stroked my inner thigh and told me I had pretty eyes under twilight anesthesia. At around hour 6 I asked to stop being injected in the face with lidocane as it was incredibly painful and he disregarded my request and ordered the nurse to do it anyway. The nurse replied "Doctor... I cant do this without consent" he took the needle and did it himself."*

She (can't recall her name as it was years ago) said. "Oh well we can't give you that in writing but I can assure you it will be Dr S doing the work." That coupled with his useless consultation which cost 150 USD and lasted for less than ten minutes and his DISGUSTING remark. "You look good already, when we are through with you, you won't be able to keep the men off of you.""*

Carney had performed the surgery more than a week earlier, but the procedure was stopped because the patient was in so much pain, Tholen said. Tholen told the patient to contact the medical board about what had happened. "I had to correct the half-completed procedure by not completing the procedure, but by undoing the problem he had created for her," Tholen said.*
