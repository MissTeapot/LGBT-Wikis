# Types of Surgery

## Hysterectomy

Removal of the uterus.

## Oophorectomy

Removal of the ovaries.

## Vaginectomy

The closing of the vaginal canal. Because this would make cervical cancer screenings impossible, a hysterectomy is required before vaginectomy.

## Metoidoplasty

A metoidoplasty, or 'Meta', constructs a neo-penis using existing genital tissue. The clitoris is lengthened and straightened in order to increase the length of protrusion. The length depends on how much the clitoris has been enlarged by testosterone, and it is generally shorter than in phalloplasty.

## Phalloplasty

Creation of a neo-penis using tissue from elsewhere on the body. Sensation can vary between types of surgeries.

### Radial Forearm Free Flap (RFF)

Removes a full-thickness graft from around the forearm, and includes part of the radial artery, radial nerve, and cephalic vein. Due to the placement, the graft scar is more visible, but has little fat, and is ideal for providing blood flow and sensation. Post-op hand/wrist mobility/sensation can be a concern, and physical therapy is often prescribed by the surgeon to mitigate this.

### Anterolateral Thigh Free Flap (ALT)

Uses a skin, fat, and fascia flap from the thigh, including part of the lateral femoral circumflex vessals and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The scarring is more easily hidden, but the effectiveness of the graft depends on skin thickness and fat content. 

### Musculocutaneous Latissimus Dorsi Free Flap (MLD)

Takes a donor flap from cutaneous and muscle tissue on the back. Due to the donor site, scarring can be minimized with this method. However, the thoracodorsal nerve that is used is a motor nerve, and so sensation is often diminished.

### Abdominal Flap

Uses donor tissue from the abdomen. Unlike many of the 'free flap' methods where the graft is entirely disconnected, ab flap is pedicled, and so the blood supply remains connected at all times. Because of the way the neo-penis is created, urethroplasty and nerve hookup can be more difficult, and not all surgeons will perform it.

### Tattooing

Tattooing is done to make the skin appear colored more like a penis, such as filling in the glans, the shaft, and/or adding veins.

### Erectile Implant/Device

If desired, a device is placed inside the neo-penis. These can include a rigid, positionable rod, or an inflatable cylinder/reservoir device.

## Scrotoplasty

Construction of a scrotum using tissue from the labia and clitoral hood.

## Urethroplasty

Also known as 'Urethral Lengthening', reconstructs and extends the urethra to pass through the tip of the neo-penis. Generally a vaginectomy is required in order to maintain support for the new urethra and prevent leakage, but not all surgeons require it. The material for the urethra can come from surrounding tissue, or in the case of phalloplasty, a skin graft.

## Testicular Implants

Prosthetic testicles are placed within the scrotum. This is generally done during a second surgery as to avoid complications with the newly constructed scrotum.
