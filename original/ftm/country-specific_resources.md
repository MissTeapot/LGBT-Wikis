***How can I get my medical transition funded by provincial healthcare?***

Some provinces fund hormones and/or surgeries for gender transition. 

**Can’t find your province?** See [here](http://trans.ichannel.ca/links-or-resource/) for a brief overview of trans health care in each province and territory.

**Alberta**: See [Trans Equality Society of Alberta](http://www.tesaonline.org/uploads/4/1/5/5/4155431/tesa-facts-grsalberta.pdf).

**British Columbia**: Medical Services Plan (MSP) funds surgeries; see [Getting Surgery by Vancouver Coastal Health](http://www.bcchildrens.ca/NR/rdonlyres/59B7C1CA-8FA8-4DE6-9FC5-74F8CC4D0DEA/61656/GettingSurgery20130104.pdf).

**Ontario**: Drugs as part of hormone therapy are not universally funded by Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). You may be eligible for partial or full drug funding via one of the [Ontario Public Drug Programs](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/drugs/) for senior citizens, low-income people, and those receiving social assistance. More info [here](http://sherbourne.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Guidelines-and-Protocols-for-Comprehensive-Primary-Care-for-Trans-Clients.pdf), p. 56. CAMH no longer offers hormone therapy, but any doctor can prescribe T provided they have the experience and are willing. For lists of trans-friendly doctors near you, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_testosterone).

OHIP currently funds top surgery, hysterectomy, and bottom surgery for trans men. If you have a valid OHIP card, you are entitled to these services. However, you must first be evaluated and approved for the surgery through a specific process. Funding for surgery can only be released after a recommendation from a [qualified physician or nurse practitioner](http://health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/srs/default.aspx) (new option) or from the [Gender Identity Clinic at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health](http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/care_program_and_services/hospital_services/Pages/gid_guide_to_camh.aspx) (CAMH) in Toronto (old option with long wait list). One exception here is a hysterectomy, which may be covered under general (not trans-related) OHIP services as long as your surgeon is willing to submit the procedure as a necessary one. The following hysto surgeons have worked with many trans men and had their hystos covered under general OHIP rather than through CAMH: Dr. Oliver and Dr. Gans are [both listed here](http://www.rrconsulting.ca/docs/RRConsulting_PhysiciansEndocrinologistsSurgeonsForTransPeople_2015.pdf).

* [Rupert Raj's Ontario Resources Page](http://www.rrconsulting.ca/resources.html) includes lists of doctors, therapists, lawyers, and community resources.

**Nova Scotia** recently began funding trans-related surgeries. Read [here](http://half-dressed.tumblr.com/tagged/srs-in-ns/) about one person's experiences in the funding process.

***How do I change my name and gender on provincial documents (birth certificate, driver’s license)?***

For your name, you must first obtain a legal name change through your provincial court. For your gender, you must first change the gender marker on your birth certificate (if you were born in Canada) or citizenship certificate (if you were born outside of Canada). Each province has a different process for name and gender change. Proof of surgery may or may not be required to change your gender marker. **Can’t find your province?** Try [TS Road Map](http://www.tsroadmap.com/reality/transgender-name-change.html). Also, get in touch with your local LGBT or trans community because very likely someone there will have up-to-date experience on the process of legal name or gender change. 

**British Columbia:** You will need to update your gender marker on your birth certificate (through the Vital Statistics Agency and[ this form](http://www.vs.gov.bc.ca/forms/vsa509a_fill.pdf)) OR fill out [this form](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/DownloadAsset?assetId=B5C7F9CC42ED4FB6A8E702A58B645033) and submit it with along with [this form](http://www.vs.gov.bc.ca/forms/vsa510p_fill.pdf) filled out by your physician to ServiceBC.  You will receive a confirmation letter saying that your gender marker is updated in the system; at this point, head down to ICBC with copies of the forms and the confirmation letter and obtain a new driver’s license with your new gender marker.  It seems wise to update name (if changing) and gender marker at the same time.  See the [ServiceBC site](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/topic.page?id=C53953157EE344A681EFD28325B526F4) for more details.

**Nova Scotia:** See [Transitioning: Legal guide by Pride Health](http://www.cdha.nshealth.ca/system/files/sites/8700/documents/trans-health-guide-translegal.pdf)

**Ontario:** 

* **Name:** The name change application for Ontario residents can be found [here](https://www.ontario.ca/government/how-do-i-apply-legal-name-change). There is a fee of $137. Most people changing their names are required to have the change published in the Ontario Gazette newspaper, but as a trans person, you can submit a [request for exception](http://www.forms.ssb.gov.on.ca/mbs/ssb/forms/ssbforms.nsf/GetFileAttach/007-11320E~1/$File/11320E.pdf) as part of your name change application. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/440tte/name_change_in_ontario/) for an important note about the Ministry only accepting documents signed in the past month. Processing time varies widely, up to 9 months. You must use this certificate as a ticket to change your name on other government identification (OHIP card, driver’s license, Canadian passport). You will also use it for school, work, and bank accounts, but be aware that some institutions will ask to see additional ID in the new name. Thus, it is recommended to change the government ID first. 

* **Sex marker:** If you were born in Ontario, you can change the sex marker on your birth certificate regardless of whether you’ve had any surgery. You will need your doctor to write a letter in support of this change. See full details [here](https://www.ontario.ca/government/changing-your-sex-designation-your-birth-registration-and-birth-certificate). Receiving the new birth certificate usually takes a few weeks. Note that there are two versions of a birth certificate, a short form and a long form. The long form certificate will show your newly amended sex marker, but also your old sex marker in brackets. See comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/2ho8ce/i_just_changed_my_gender_marker_but_theres_a/).

* If you have a birth certificate from a different province, you must change the sex marker on that through the proper channels and then use the new certificate as a ticket to change all your other ID. 

* If you have a birth certificate from a different country, then whatever it says on that certificate doesn’t matter to the Canadian government. In Canada, your official gender/sex is determined by your Canadian citizenship certificate. Citizenship and Immigration Canada’s [policy](http://overseastudent.ca/migratetocanada/IMMGuide/CICManual/cp/cp03-eng.pdf) (section 6) still requires you to present proof of surgery, as well as a letter from somebody who knows you, in order to change the gender marker on your citizenship certificate. The policy does not specify exactly what surgery (top, bottom) is required. The application costs $75. Processing time is [quite lengthy](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/canada/certif-processing.asp). After receiving your new citizenship certificate, you will use it as a ticket to change your other government ID. 

* **Sex marker on driver’s license:** In Ontario, the sex marker on your driver’s license can be changed without any surgery, provided a letter of support from your doctor. You may be charged a fee for the placement card. See [here](http://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/admin/contentEngine/contentDocuments/Legal_Sex_Designation_Change_in_Ontario.pdf), page 2. 

* **Sex marker on OHIP:** You may be considering changing the sex marker on your OHIP card. Be aware that this may affect the health care services that you receive. OHIP’s computers have an algorithm that systematically rejects procedures that don’t make sense for the sex indicated—for example, a person with an M on their health card who gets a Pap test or a mammogram would be flagged by the computer. If you change your sex marker to an M without having had top or bottom surgery, this issue could arise. Your health care provider can still file proceedings to have your treatments accepted by the system, but this could be more complicated and time-consuming for you and your provider. See [here](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ohip/ohipfaq_mn.aspx), at the bottom.

***How do I change my name and gender marker on federal documents (Passport, SIN Registry)?***

**Name:** First obtain a legal name change certificate (or updated birth certificate) in your province, then use that as a ticket to change your federal documents. It is advisable to first change your provincial documents (driver’s license, health card) before dealing with federal documents, because the federal ones generally ask to see other ID in the new name. **Note:** The legal name change certificate is not sufficient to change the name on the Passport, as of 03/2015. Your supporting documents (i.e. citizenship certificate or birth certificate) must also have the new name. See [here](http://www.passport.gc.ca/info/section1.aspx?lang=eng).

**Sex marker on Canadian Passport:** You must complete a [full application](http://passport.gc.ca/form/pdfs/pptc153.pdf) rather than a renewal, no matter how new your current passport is. You have several options in the way of “proof”:
Provide either a Canadian birth certificate or a Canadian citizenship certificate showing the new sex.
Or, provide “medical documentation to confirm that you have undergone a sex change, and that the surgery is complete.” Note that the specific type of surgery required is unspecified; some people have successfully applied with top surgery by having their surgeons write a letter calling it “transsexual surgery” or “gender reassignment surgeon”. 
If you can't provide either of the above, you may still obtain a limited validity passport with the correct sex marker. The passport will only be valid for two years rather than the regular five, and the applicant must provide “medical documentation indicating that he or she will be undergoing sex reassignment surgery in the next twelve months.” The applicant must also sign form [PPTC152](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67321046/PPTC152.pdf) to acknowledge the potential risks of this change.

**Sex marker on Social Insurance Number (SIN) card:** Although the SIN card itself does not show an M or F, the SIN computer database does include a gender marker on your record. To update this, you must present either a Canadian birth certificate or Canadian citizenship certificate showing the new gender. A letter from a surgeon will not suffice. Apply at your local Service Canada location for free. If you are unable to visit one of these locations, you may be eligible to [apply by mail](http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/search/eforms/index.cgi?app=prfl&amp;frm=nas2120&amp;ln=eng).

**Sex marker on citizenship certificate:** If you were born in a different country from Canada, then it is the sex on your Canadian citizenship certificate that will determine the sex on all other federal documents. Citizenship and Immigration Canada’s [policy](http://overseastudent.ca/migratetocanada/IMMGuide/CICManual/cp/cp03-eng.pdf) (section 6) requires you to present proof of surgery, as well as a letter from somebody who knows you, in order to change the gender marker on your citizenship certificate. The policy does not specify exactly what surgery (top, bottom) is required. The application costs $75. Processing time is [quite lengthy](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/canada/certif-processing.asp). After receiving your new citizenship certificate, you will use it as a ticket to change other ID. Note that for your Canadian passport, you can change the sex marker directly with a surgery letter instead of waiting around for the citizenship certificate to come through. However, your sex marker on the SIN record can only be changed using a citizenship certificate as evidence. **Update 06/2015:** Citizenship Canada is in the process of changing its policy for change of sex marker. It seems that surgery will no longer be required, but the new requirements are not yet confirmed. See [here](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/cit/admin/id/gender.asp).

***How can I change my legal name?*** 

There are two ways to change your name, but we’ll only cover the easiest and cheapest way. The easiest way to get a legal name change is through [Deed Pol](http://www.deedpoll.org.uk/)l, and it costs £37 in total, including shipping [assuming you aren’t purchasing legal copies and choose UK standard shipping].  With the linked company, they send out your Deed Poll package and you’ll receive it within 4 working days. The enclosed package includes your Deed Poll; a list of who to inform about your name change; how to sign/execute your Deed Poll; how to obtain a new NHS medical card; and an example letter notifying record holders of your name change. The Deed Poll itself requires you to date it, sign your new name, your former name, and have an independent witness who is over 18 years old, not related to you and not live at the same address as you. 

You can also change your name by Deed Poll for free using [this form](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fhmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk%2Fcourtfinder%2Fforms%2Floc020-eng.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwC1ac2cctrybI69fv_gvI-Z1mpA). This process requires two witnesses. More information [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll).

***
***How can I change my legal gender?***

You must apply for a [Gender Recognition Certificate](https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate/changing-your-gender). In order to do this must have been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, be 18 or over,  have lived as male for at least 2 years, and applied to the Gender Recognition Panel. 

To apply to the Gender Recognition Panel, you need to use [this form](http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/courtfinder/forms/t450-eng.pdf). The application requires you to make a Statutory Declaration (provided in the form), provide evidence of dissolved marriage/civil partnership (if any, and soon to be void in Scotland), a copy of all change of name documents (it’s assumed a legal copy of your original deed poll will be enough), a medical report by two people, and documents supporting that you have in fact being living as male for at least 2 years. [This guide](http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/courtfinder/forms/t451-eng.pdf) explains how to fill out the application form, and gives examples of what is considered as support.

If your application is approved by the Gender Recognition Panel, then you will receive a new short birth certificate with information on how to obtain a full birth certificate and a list of all the necessary people to contact about your legal change in gender. 

***
***How can I get my hormones or surgery funded by the NHS?***

This depends on where you live, and which NHS you will be dealing with. 

## NHS England

In order to medically transition on the NHS, you are required to be seen by a NHS Gender Identity Clinic (GIC), of which there are many throughout the country. NHS Gender Clinics typically have an average waiting list of 6 months or more [Though Nottingham and Exeter may have a shorter waiting time], and it is very realistic to expect to be waiting around a year for your initial appointment. 

In order to be seen by a GIC, you need to have your GP refer you to one.

Another option is to enter a Shared Care agreement with a private doctor. This doctor would diagnose you and recommend hormone therapy, and your blood work and prescriptions would be covered by NHS.

## NHS Scotland

In Scotland there are two options: a) get a referral via your GP, or b) self-refer yourself. There’s only one NHS gender clinic within Scotland, [Sandyford](http://www.sandyford.org/do-you-want-information-on-sexual-orientation-or-gender-identity/gender-identity/sandyford-gender-identity-services.aspx), and after your initial appointment, they’ll explain how to get on hormones. For more information, they have an [information booklet](http://www.sandyford.org/media/88274/genderidentityservice_sf%5B1%5D.pdf). It’s worth noting that the current waiting list to receive your initial appointment is roughly 13 months (as of July 2014). 

## England Private Health Care

If you want to get on testosterone through a private doctor, there are two main private clinics in England, both based in London.

* [Transhealth](http://www.transhealth.co.uk/index.html) ran by Dr. Richard Curtis

* [Gendercare](http://gendercare.co.uk/) ran by Dr. Stuart Lorimer and Dr. Leighton Seal

## Scotland Private Health Care

Unlike the rest of the UK, NHS Scotland won’t partially cover your private health care, e.g. bloodwork. You may be able to break your GP down and get them to agree to do some bloodwork on you. For this reason it can be beneficial to have a trans* friendly GP. 

There are various private gender clinics throughout the UK, and you’ll expect to pay between £220 - £250 for your initial appointment. However, there is only one clinic in Scotland: [YourGP](http://your-gp.com/services/sexual-health-gender-clinic/gender-dysphoria/) in Edinburgh.

YourGP prices are, as of 2014:

* £230  - The Initial Appointment with Dr. Myskow

* £200 - The therapist appointment

* £270 - The blood works appointment 

* £230 (or less, depending on how long you need to see Dr. Myskow) - The follow up appointment. 

Also, Dr. Myskow requires you to have changed your name and documents and had some RLE before prescribing hormones. 

When going private, it is best to also have your name on the Sandyford waiting list, this way you can transition no problem over to the NHS when your name comes up.

***How do I legally change my name or gender in my state?***

## California

See [Changing Legal Identity Documents in California](http://transgenderlawcenter.org/issues/id/changing-legal-identity-documents-in-california) by Transgender Law Center.

## Indiana

To legally change your name in Indiana, you can either hire an attorney or do it yourself. Use the appropriate document [here](http://www.in.gov/judiciary/selfservice/2338.htm). Make sure you review your county’s [court rules](http://www.in.gov/judiciary/2694.htm) to find out how many copies of the documents you need, and if there are any additional forms or procedures required by your county.

Depending on your county, you may be charged a fee when turning in the documents to the clerk of the court. 

The name change process can take up to 3 months, whether you hire an attorney or do it yourself.

## Massachusetts

See the [Massachusetts Court System Guide to Name Changes](http://www.mass.gov/courts/selfhelp/name-changes/). This guide covers social security as well.

1. Change your name legally at your local court. See [here](http://www.mass.gov/courts/selfhelp/name-changes/) for more information.

You will have to fill out a form with your old and new name and sign it. For the ‘reasons for change section’, putting down, common usage worked for me. You may be called into court, but more likely the judge will sign off on the form without you. Ask at your local courthouse. You can find your local courthouse [here](http://www.mass.gov/courts/selfhelp/family/pfc-where-do-i-file.html).

2. Change your name on your social security card as soon as you can, see above

3. Change your name on any government issued ID - driver’s license, state ID card, passport.

4. Change your name on bank accounts, insurance, and other institutions.

Always look at when the information was written, because laws and procedures may have changed between then and now. Also, get in touch with your local LGBT or trans community because very likely someone there will have up-to-date experience on the process of legal name or gender change.

## Free Name Change

[The Name Change Project](http://tldef.org/work_show.php?id=7) helps low-income, trans individuals to change their names for free in certain counties of NY, IL, MI, WI, and PA.

**[Social Security, Gender](http://transequality.org/Resources/SSAResource_June2013.pdf)**: Although your social security card does not listen your gender, the associated computer database does. You can change this gender marker with a letter from your physician. Surgery is not required. Also see the [SSA official policy](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0110212200).

**Selective Service**: If you change your social security gender marker to Male and are between the ages of 18 and 25, you may be required to register with the Selective Service (a.k.a. the draft) in order to qualify for certain benefits such as federally-funded financial aid for higher education. See [Hudson's FTM Guide](http://ftmguide.org/selectiveservice.html) for more information.

In some US states, Selective Service registration is linked with the state ID or driver's license database. This means that if you apply for a driver's license while age 25 or under, with a male gender marker in the social security database, you may be automatically registered for Selective Service. See the [Selective Service website](https://www.sss.gov/Registration/State-Commonwealth-Legislation).

**[Passport, Name](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/services/correction.html#Changes)**: You can apply for a new passport with your new name, providing a proof of legal name change. The fee will depend on how old your current passport is. 

**[Passport, Gender](http://transequality.org/Resources/passports_2014.pdf)**: You do not need to have any kind of surgery for changing your gender marker on your passport. In lieu of a surgery letter, you can have your physician write a statement that says you have had the “appropriate clinical treatment” for gender transition, regardless of whether you have undergone hormone therapy or had surgery. Also see the [DoS official policy](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/143160.pdf).

***Does Planned Parenthood supervise hormone therapy for trans folk?***

Some Planned Parenthood clinics are known to do this. See locations [here](http://plannedparenthood.tumblr.com/post/86714508239/does-planned-parenthood-offer-hormone-replacement).

- /u/TurtleTape shares his experience (March 2015, North Carolina) here:

&gt;Although it isn't well-advertised, many Planned Parenthood clinics also act as LGBT resource and health centers, including offering HRT on an informed consent basis. The website, http://www.plannedparenthood.org/, has a tool that lets people search for local clinics. Each clinic's page lists the basic things the clinic offers, with LGBT services being one of the headings. Clicking this heading generally shows a few examples of what they offer.

&gt;My local PP clinic, for example, lists “hormonal treatments for transgender clients” as one of its services. They also offer referrals, and mine in particular has a list of all trans friendly therapists in the area they will willingly give out when asked.

&gt;My experience was relatively simple. I called them and asked if they offer informed consent, and after confirming I was over 18 they confirmed they did. They asked which direction I was going, and set me an appointment. These clinics are often busy, and my appointment was set a month in advance.

&gt;The appointment consisted of me filling out a few forms, such as medical history, drinking practices, financial situation, support system, etc., before being invited into a room. There, they confirmed some information, briefly talked to me about dysphoria and my identity, and then brought in the doctor. She went over the IC papers to ensure I knew what I was getting into with T, asked if I had any questions, then left.

&gt;They drew blood, took my blood pressure, and checked my iron levels. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming, so it was easy to relax after the initial meeting. My particular clinic requires blood test results before giving the prescription, so it took a couple of weeks to get a call to set up another appointment.

&gt;A month after my blood work appointment, I had my prescription appointment. It lasted about half an hour, during which one nurse did a demonstration on how to do an IM injection in the thigh. They also gave me a detailed brochure that walks through every step of the process. Then I got a prescription and that was it.

&gt;The clinic does bill insurance when possible, but quotes the total uninsured price over the phone. Without insurance, they quoted $150-200 for initial blood work. They require patients to come in three months after starting hormones to check levels. I have not had this appointment yet, due to having to cancel it, but I can update this with more information after I've had it. 

&gt; **Update Sept 2015:** My follow-up appointment actually took place nine months after my initial dose. Because I was not able to attend my three month appointment, I had to give a signature because of regulations, but that was the only “problem” with having a late appointment.
When I checked in, I was given a clip board with a couple of things to sign and one other paper with a lot of blank lines. This third paper was for me to fill in what changes I had experienced. This form included a list of things, such as genitals, emotions, body/facial hair, etc., for me to fill in changes for. There was also an “other” field for anything not already covered. However, for me all of the changes were covered in the options offered. The paper asked if I wanted to change my dose.

&gt; They took my blood pressure and did a finger prick for iron, and then the main doctor came in. We talked for a bit about life and medical stuff, such as the fact that I really should get a pap smear/pelvic exam at some point, but they will never force me to get that exam if I do not want to do it.

&gt; Most of the appointment was either waiting for someone to show up or talking. Since I don't want to change my dose (50mg/week), the doc originally wanted to see me in six months, but high blood pressure made her amend that to three months. So being happy with results means fewer appointments, but if an issue is found or you want your dosage changed then more frequent ones may be required.
