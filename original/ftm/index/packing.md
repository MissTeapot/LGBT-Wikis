# Packing
**Updated: 2020-11-23**
***
##What kind of packer should I get?

**Update 05/2015**: /u/LESBIANGINGER has compiled a more comprehensive list of [Packers, Prosthetics, and STPs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jdzz6moo3tKlwF0w9CONfNujb7HBkfK1_leaQJSd-Ww/edit?usp=sharing).

Some trans men like to pack some or all of the time. A packer can serve three different functions: to pack in your pants, to stand to pee (STP), and to have sex with (Play). You need to decide what you want from the packer. 

You also need to think about what size you want. The average flaccid penis is only around [3.5 inches \(8.9 cm\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis_size#Flaccid_length), so if you’re packing only for a bulge, keep this in mind. Packers made for Play are typically larger and more rigid—good for sex, but they might not be so comfortable to pack in your pants all day. 

STP packers have a receptacle that fits over your urethra, catching your urine and directing it through a tube that exits through the tip of the penis on the packer. The products available have different styles of receptacle and you might find that some work better than others.

##How can I keep my packer in place?

If you wear briefs or boxer briefs, you may be fine just wearing the packer loose in your the underwear.  A jockstrap (without the hard cup) is even better since it has a dedicated pouch. If you wear boxers, or you want to secure your packer a bit more, there are several harness options. For sports or exercise, a more secure harness is a smart idea.

###Homemade

* Put the packer in a small, thin sock and attach the sock to your underwear waistband with a safety pin

* [Videos:](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=FTM+harness) Make your own harness; some sewing may be required

* [The Full Monty harness](http://www.ftmpassingtips.com/FullMonty316.pdf) (no sewing required)

Keywords to find packing underwear that isn't sold specifically for ftm folks: "pocket underwear", "separate pouch", "packing underwear", "scrotum separation"

###Foam Cup Packing Underwear
Additionally, here are some options for underwear foam cups that aren't packers. These might be useful if you need something lighter than a packer, or in a bathing suit. They all seem to be the same product, but different prices and vendors.

##Do I need to pack to pass as male?

No. In almost all situations, whether or not you have a visible bulge has no effect on your perceived gender. Look around; many men simply don’t have a bulge that shows through their pants. Many trans men don’t pack at all because they don’t feel the need to, and still live their lives as males. Packing is a personal choice.

Some situations where you might want to pack because a lack of bulge would be noticed:

* Wearing tights or very tight-fitting pants

* A social event where there’s a chance you’ll be groped

* The [No Pants Subway Ride](http://improveverywhere.com/missions/the-no-pants-subway-ride/)
