# Sex
**Updated: 2020-11-23**

***
There can be great diversity in how to have sex.  We don't all enjoy the same things, but the following are common topics: disclosure in casual sex, disclosure in relationships, dysphoria, effects of testosterone, orgasms, prosthetics, and surgeries. For many discussions about sex and sexuality, see [threads on /r/ftm](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=sex&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and the [ftm-in-bed](http://ftm-in-bed.livejournal.com) LiveJournal community.

If you're a trans man who has sex with men, check out this sexual health guide: [Primed: The Back Pocket Guide for Trans Men and the Men Who Dig Them](http://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/resources/primed-the-back-pocket-guide-for-trans-men-and-the-men-who-dig-them/).

##Can I use packers for sex?

Only use packers that have been specifically designed for ‘pack and play’ (see [Packing](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_packing)). Always use a condom over the packer. This is because you’ve either used corn starch to stop it from sticking, or you’ve not used corn starch and that can make the packer collect dirt. Using a condom blocks the transfer to your partner of anything that may be stuck to the packer, and this lowers the risk of infection. It also ensures that the packer doesn’t absorb anything.

##How and when can I disclose my trans identity to potential sexual partners?

When to disclose it is completely up to you. Some people disclose up-front upon meeting the person; others way until things get more serious. You probably want to disclose before it’s time to undress so that your partner doesn't get too much of a surprise. 

For casual hook-ups, you may wish to wait to disclose until you know that the hook-up is definitely going to happen. With more serious encounters that may turn into long-term relationships, wait until it feels right. Be sure that you feel safe in the time, place, and context in which you are disclosing. You may want to first get a feel for the person’s opinions on LGBT issues and on gender, because these may help you gauge what their reaction would be. When you disclose your trans status your partner may react angrily, calling you a liar. Be patient and calmly remind them that you are indeed male, just as you told them you were. It just so happens that your anatomy is not what they expected for a typical male.
