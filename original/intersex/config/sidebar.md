____________________________________
/r/intersex is the place to talk about intersex topics with intersex Redditors. Everything inter* is permitted as long as it plays along our rules! (But remember, we are no substitute for real medical professionals.)

**Subreddit Rules**  

* No Bigotry: We're here to support intersex lives, but this also goes as far as other marginalized groups. Furthering the marginalization of ANYONE here will result in a ban.

* Research &amp; Surveys: Anyone looking to post surveys or requests for intersex people to provide info for research should send a reddit message to /r/intersex first, make sure to include your questions.

* No Exclusion: Arguments over who is or isn't intersex should be kept to private messages or off of the subreddit. Polite explanations of what aren't or are intersex are acceptable, however.

* Sexualized Content: This is not the place for sexualized or titillating content. Discussions about biology and issues related to intersex conditions are fine, but keep your sexual content on your Onlyfans. Needless to say any content fetishizing or 'chasing' intersex people is unwelcome.

* Graphical Nudity/Pictures: Please don't post pictures of your genitalia or nude body here. You can discuss your body and issues, but unwarranted pictures are unwanted.

* "Am I Intersex?" posts shouldn't be posted, because we can't give you a yes or no - we can only tell you to see a doctor. There are resources in the FAQ linked above.

* The "H"-Word: Don't use it. It has a really rough history of abuse and is used in fetishizing intersex people. It has no place in use when discussing human people and our bodies. Want to reclaim it? Use it anywhere but here.
