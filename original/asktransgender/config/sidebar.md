Rule| Details
---|---
1. Your post should be relevant, encourage discussion, and be inclusive. | We prefer that titles be in the form of a question, but if this is not possible, please make sure either the post title or content provides a starting point for discussion. -- Use inclusive language e.g. Not "How did you ladies choose a female name?" but instead "How did you find your new name?"
2. Be respectful, especially about how people identify themselves. | No bigotry (transphobia, homophobia, sexism, racism, etc); no hateful speech or disrespectful commentary; no personal attacks; no [gendered slurs](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderedslurs); no [invalidation](/r/asktransgender/wiki/invalidation); no [gender policing](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderpolicing); no shaming based on stealth, open or closeted status.
3. No personal agendas. | /r/asktransgender is a place for discussion and is not a soapbox. If a post or comment indicates a personal agenda, or if it's clear they have not come here with an open mind, their post(s) will be removed.
4. No stirring the pot. | Please do not post threads that intentionally create drama, target a different sub or link to threads in a different sub, or otherwise encourage brigading.
5. Minors **under the age of 13** are not allowed on reddit. We are required to report members identifying as such to the reddit admins.  | "Although we welcome users from all walks of life, reddit is not aimed at children, and the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account with us. If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us." [reddit.com Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy#wiki_children_under_13)
6. [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasktransgender) for approval before posting a questionnaire, survey, promotion, or advertisement. | Please review [our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/rule6) for these types of post. Additionally, note that we do not allow fundraising posts/requests under any circumstances.
7. Posts with NSFW content must be marked. | Posts that center around genitals, breasts, sex, or content you would not discuss with coworkers, your grandmother, or other delicate company should be marked as NSFW.
8. No fetishizing or chasers | We will remove any posts treating trans bodies as fetishes or objects, and any posts that indicate your attraction is more important than your partner's dysphoria.
