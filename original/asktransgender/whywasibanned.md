#**Why Was I Banned?**

The most likely reason is, *you were breaking the [Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/rules)*. We hand out these bans for incivility: personal attacks, racism, bigotry, transphobia, et cetera. 

**You need to be nice and keep all comments civil.**

Outstandingly bad rule breaches–like a bigoted troll–will be permanently banned.  Instances where someone has, for example, attacked another user, we give a temporary ban. In both cases relevant comments are removed.

Spam, repeated rule violations, or other issues that are subject to moderator discretion may receive bans as well. 

The reason for your ban is stated in the "you've been banned" message. If a reason is not stated or if you have a question related to your ban, please message us back. 

##Permanent Ban

It's unlikely that we will lift a permanent ban. If you absolutely honestly believe it was in error, send us a polite modmail and we'll take a second look. But most likely, you'll not be able to comment again in /r/asktransgender as your behavior is not acceptable here. 

*Note: ban evasion by creating new accounts is against Reddit's rules. Users attempting to evade bans will be reported to the Reddit admins.*

##Temporary Ban

Temporary bans are our way of saying, *"Hey, that's not acceptable behaviour."* Temporary bans are temporary. 

**I accept the ban and will not be uncivil in the future**

No hard feelings, we still want you here. If you've received a temporary ban it will tell you how long it lasts(ex. *"you have been banned for: 1 days"*). Please be aware that consecutive temporary bans may eventually result in a permanent ban. 

**I disagree with the ban! I want to appeal!** 

We may have made a mistake. Please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasktransgender). Please remain calm and civil. A mod will review the situation, and either explain why we still believe the ban is legitimate, or apologize and remove the ban. Keep in mind that a polite modmail can go a long way. We know that everyone has their bad moments, and we do honestly review the situation when you modmail us.
