#**Why Was My Post Removed?**

The most likely reason is, *you were breaking the [Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/rules)*. We remove posts that: invalidate, exclude, or police others; use gendered slurs; soap box personal agendas. 

Please note: *In cases where mods have to continually remove a user's posts, temporary or permanent bans may be applied to your account depending on the severity.*

##Why was I asked to edit my post? 

If possible, users are invited to edit their post for approval, if the post is edited appropriately, it will be approved. 

##My post was removed by mistake

We may have misunderstood you. If you feel your post was removed by mistake, [please message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasktransgender), please remain calm and civil. A mod will review the situation, and either explain why we still believe the removal is legitimate, or apologize and approve the post.
