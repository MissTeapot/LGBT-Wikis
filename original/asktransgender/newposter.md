##First Posters:

*I want to post here but I don't know what to say and I don't want to offend anyone*

First off it takes a tremendous amount of courage to take those first steps. I for one am proud of you, and as I think you'll find, everyone else here will be too. I know when I was drafting my first post I had no idea what to put down. It felt pretty lame to just say *"I think I'm transgender,"* or *"Am I transgender?"* Let's be real, those are lame post titles. But if that's all you've got then we understand.

The idea of a topic title is to give everyone an "at a glance" of your post. It's going to answer questions such as:

* What is this post going to be about?
* Is the poster looking for discussion or is just to get something off their chest?

Whatever you want your post to be, that's up to you. What's our recommendation? Be honest, it's the first step. Are you feeling trans* or are you questioning? Say so. We're here to help.

###Topic Examples:

* I feel like I might be trans* but there's still a lot I don't know. Help?
* I don't have medical insurance but I want to start HRT, any idea how?
* My primary care provider is requiring an informed consent letter. What is that and where do I get it?
* What is dysphoria?
* Feeling depressed about this or that. Does anyone have any advice?

All of examples follow a pretty standard guideline. This is /r/AskTransgender, and if you can, it helps to start with a question. But like we said before, if you can't, it's OK.

**I'm sure my question has been asked before but I can't find it. Is it still okay to post?**

This community extends back quite a ways. Finding those perfect search terms can be a nightmare. That's one of the reasons this Wiki is here.
