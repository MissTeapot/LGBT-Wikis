If you'd like to post a survey, study, interview request, or similar on the subreddit, make sure that it meets the following criteria first:

* If it is being conducted from/within an academic institution, it must be approved by your university's IRB (institutional review board). You will need to provide some evidence of this approval to us, as well. We do not accept academic surveys without IRB approval.

* If it is for a news article or similar, you will need to provide some form of proof of identity (links to other published articles, etc.).

* If it is for commercial product evaluation/interest gauging or similar, as above, you will need to provide evidence of employment with the business conducting the survey (company bio page, LinkedIn, etc.).

* It must have a specific focus on the transgender population at large. Neither having a trans cohort as part of the sample, nor focusing specifically on subgroups within the trans umbrella (eg. a survey only focused on trans women), are acceptable.

Please elaborate on the ways that your submission fulfills whichever criteria are applicable when you message the moderation team to request permission to post it.
