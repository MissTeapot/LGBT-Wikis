# Everyone is welcome here!

Creating transdermal gels and sprays at home, for ALL those in need - menopausal women, trans women, men who want a soft skin, bio hackers, enbies, trans men, men with low-T, etc. Check [our FAQ for an introduction to homebrewed transdermals](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/g5rckk/faq_for_the_estrogel_sub/) and [our wiki for vast amounts of information, research, and recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/wiki/index/).

# Safety first!

We believe gels applied to the skin are inherently safer than injecting, and when making HRT yourself safety is paramount. Maintaining safety outside a professional laboratory is difficult and should be designed to be fail safe. Screw it up and what might seriously harm you to inject is more far more likely to be safe on the skin.

Safety in never having to worry about getting cut off from your treatment because you can't afford it, your doctor retires, or there's supply chain problems. A few hundred dollars will buy you a 50+ years supply of estrogen for HRT. 

Safety in being able to use what you need instead of relying on out of date medical practitioners. Our high strength gels have the same potency as injections, and you can adjust formulations as needed. 

And that's just the start of our guerilla healthcare!
