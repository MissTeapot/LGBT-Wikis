A sub for the discussion of transgender surgery
*****

## **Subreddit [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/about/rules/)**

**Zero.** *Do not be disruptive.*

**1.** Be respectful to others, including identity and choices in surgery. Be polite and engage in [civil discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_discourse).

**2.** Posts with NSFW content must be marked NSFW. Some posts with image links will be marked automatically, and you can un-mark them if necessary.

**3.** Report chasers, trolls and hate speech. *Do not engage, let the mods take care of it.* Arguing with trolls encourages them and makes moderation more difficult.

**4.** Keep posts on topic. Surgery and electrolysis only. No fundraising, surveys, research, petitions, advertising, or memes. General *"Am I going to pass"* posts that are not specifically related to surgery are not on topic; post them in r/transpassing instead. Posts with links require an introduction to explain why the link is of interest to the community and you must engage in conversation - no posting here to simply to advertise your blog/Discord/YouTube channel.

**5.** This sub is by and for trans people. *Partners, carers, etc,* with a legitimate interest in surgery may post if its of clear benefit to a trans individual or the community. *Intersex* people who have related surgical interests may post. Do not post otherwise. Others can post on r/asktransgender. People that only or primarily post compliments on this and other trans subs are likely to be banned. If you're not sure, ask first.

**6.** Posts by people with a commercial interest in members decisions. Please follow [these rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/exrxnh/rule_6_posts_from_those_with_a_commercial/). You will be assigned a *light yellow flair* next to your user name.

**7.** English only. I can't moderate in languages other than English.

**8.** No posts whose primary purpose is to discuss other people (face, surgery, etc). Discussing yourself and comparing to others is allowed, however at all times bear in mind rule 1.

**9.** No sexually suggestive compliments or comments that may be interpreted that way. If the mods need to look at your post history to see if you're a chaser then its not appropriate. [Read more...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/iwt54n/rule_9_sexual_comments/)

**10.** Photo requests for FFS advice must include appropriate photos. [Read more...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/mfqno2/requests_for_help_choosing_ffs_procedures/)
