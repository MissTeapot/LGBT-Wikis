I think you would be better to go to community health to get assistance for your psychosis." The next I explained it too looked at me slack jawed and kept muttering in Indian before leaving the room. I waited for 15 mins until the Nurse/Sister arrived and explain the doctor is unwilling to aid as it was an ethical issue for him. The best part is the doctor is strongly apposed to anything LGBTQI related and vocal in public since then."*

However after arriving to the clinic, excited and hopeful, i instantly became nervous and doubtful as the Dr I was seeing was quite disgusted and upset of my appearance (Dr Llweyn Waters). I gave him the prescription script along with the Reandron and told him the situation, he looked at me and said "I dont know you" (lets make it clear I used to be a patient at this clinic for 6 years when I was younger), along with "You are off the streets". I tried to keep calm and explain again that I need this administrated by a professional and he is someone who does in fact administrate medicines to patients. Though not to my surprise he then says "Im not going to give someone who is off the street this, I dont understand how you could even put this in your body"*
