Offensive content
===

As a safe space, /r/lgbt does not allow for offensive content. Many users come for a space to be welcomed in, and some comments are hostile and alienating. Being a GSRM space, it should be an outright given that all queer -phobias and -isms are not welcome at all. Similarly offensive content is elaborated on below. Some examples are listed.

##Denying one's identity
----

There is only one person in this world who can determine you identity for you: yourself. In light of the idea that no two experiences are the same, it follows that one cannot make judgements on another over their identity. If someone identifies with a label, but does not follow the norms another associates with it, it does not make such a label any less legitimate.
  
* Gatekeeping is an unfortunately common example of this. Gatekeeping specifically refers to making judgements to police another's gender identity. Comments like "if you're a trans woman, why do you dress like a guy?" "If you're genderqueer, but you're trying to correct your body, isn't that just two steps forward and one step back?" "You don't want surgery? So you're obviously comfortable with your body!" and "This is an important decision you are making with your life. Are you sure you want to go down this road?" are just some pretty blatant (but widespread) forms of bigotry.
* You can identify as straight and have a relationship with someone of the same gender, and identify as gay and have a relationship with someone of a different gender. Situations like this arise all the time, and are perfectly acceptable. Oftentimes there are people who ask for help unraveling their identity. Making comments like "if you're attracted to her you're probably gay" could be helpful when they are looking for affirmation, but cannot be depended on at all times. If your comment appears to deny their identity more than it helps them figure it out for themself, it breaks this rule.
* "You can't be ace and still have sex!" is a common example regarding misconceptions of what defines asexuality or other non-normative romantic identities and sexual desires. Situations such as this arise often and in no way conflict with the identity.
  
Erasure is another issue which falls under this category. Erasure is not so much challenging one's identity as it is challenging the identity itself. Much like one can try to separate two people with the same identity but different expressions or experiences, one can take two identities and call them the same. Erasure commonly disregards an identity's presence or influence by refusing to acknowledge it, even if it is accepted that the identity exists.
  
* "If you're bi, you're just on the fence" is probably the most common example of this bigotry. Another iteration would be "if you're bi and married, does it even matter anymore?"
* "Pansexual is just someone who is bi but wants to sound special" is something that is often asserted when told the definition of pansexual. "Demisexual is just trying to look different" is another common example of this.
* The lack of awareness of groups that are not well-represented by mainstream queer rights organizations is an aspect of erasure. While asexuals, queer people of color, non-gender-conforming trans* people, and countless other identities are acknowledged to exist, there is little representation of their interests in many large organizations.
  
A final note, which would otherwise fall under "blatant transphobia" and should be assumed as 101 knowledge, is a common enough issue in /r/lgbt—and reddit as a whole—that it actually needs to be mentioned here. That is the usage of pronouns. Pronouns are a vital part of the english language, and one of the core pieces of information in a gender identity. For cis people, their pronouns are correct and taken for granted, and it may feel like a very little thing to be mistaken, but when being trans* is so difficult and central in many people's lives, such a small and unconscious thing is far more important. When fighting so hard in this world to be affirmed of the correct gender identity, being misgendered is more than just a mistake, it is a slap in the face.
  
Accidentially using the wrong pronouns is a common occurance in english (purposely misgendering someone, though, is grounds for harsh and immediate action). There is a common tendency to use male pronouns towards strangers, both in language in general, and on the Internet. Some people attribute this to a common rule in language that when referring to both genders one defaults to male pronouns, others attribute it to the assumption that other people online are male (see the sexism section below). Regardless, it is in poor taste in a space that would like to be welcoming to people of all or no genders. "He or she" does not serve, as it erases non-binary and non-conforming gender identities.
  
An acceptable solution is to use singular "they" as the default pronoun, which is gradually becoming far more grammatically acceptable to use. If you are uncomfortable defying your high school english teachers' orders, you could refer to people by their names, use 'one' or 'you,' or any other sidesteps in the english language. Using 'it' is grounds for removal.
  
Or, you know, you can just ask someone for their pronouns!

##Dehumanization and generalization
----

Even in the context of experiental perspectives, there still exist ways to put down other people. Making generalizations about identities, descriptors, and other such labels—and the people who use them—is bigotry.
  
Comments on how you expect people to act, and your preconceived judgement on them due to these expectations, serve to reduce a person to a sum of stereotypes. Alienating someone for looking or acting in a specific manner takes out of the equation their own experiences and replaces them with society's. Even if this preconception is not necessarily a negative one it still serves to undermine one's individuality. This act of projecting ideas onto other people is dehumanizing.
  
* "Personally, I think camp gay men are obnoxious and give us all a bad name" is an unfortunately common example of these sorts of comments, and it exists both within and without the queer community to try to strip an identity of any independence; it is, for all intents and purposes, stating "I wish gay people would act more straight." There is nothing wrong with 'acting straight' as well, so making jabs at people for "trying to deny it" or anything like that is equally unacceptable.
* "When I was in college, every girl who said she was bi was just saying to get laid," again, a stereotype masked under the guise of personal experience. If it isn't mentioned in the very definition of the label, please refrain from making a broad statement about it.
  
A specificly common extension of this rule is that of attraction. Attraction comes in every range and magnitude, and only you can know who you are attracted to. However, attraction is often used as an excuse of personal experience to justify generalizations and bigotries. In a negative form, they may deny people their identity and exclude people who don't follow the perspective you've assigned them. In a positive, they serve to fetishize them. Reducing someone to an object to be sexualized is in incredibly poor taste. /r/lgbt is a space where you can feel open to discuss topics of sex (please remember to mark these discussions NSFW!) but please keep swathing generalizations to yourself.

##Sexism
----

Because gender is such an important part of queer politics, gender equality is an incredibly important goal for our rights. /r/lgbt, as a queer space, is therefore a feminist space as well. People come to this subreddit to avoid being harrassed, put down, or dehumanized for for their identity already, so please don't perpetuate that same mindset within the subreddit. Please, therefore, refrain from making sexist remarks. This applies to all contexts, even if queerness as an identity is not involved. Gendered slurs are not allowed here either. Many people in /r/lgbt are well-versed in gender politics, but some of us may be less than familiar, or not experienced with feminist theory. You are not required to take any classes on Gender Studies or anything like that to participate here, and we acknowledge that oftentimes the remarks are well meaning, but if you are being called out on misogyny, please be respectful and willing to learn from your mistakes.
  
* "Bitch," "slut," and other gendered insults and slurs are not acceptable here (no matter who it is being used against), just as queerphobic slurs are. The english language is a beautiful medium of communication, and there are an infinite other ways to demonstrate vulgarity. A note to non-US members: people have made endless excuses about how "cunt" is a non-gendered term in many places. Reddit is a largely US-centric community so while it may not hold the same weight and history to you, it does to many, many others here.
* Being sexist towards a trans person in an attempt to affirm their gender is not a good idea. Try to convey your compliments like an adult.
* You're not required to identify as a feminist to post here, but don't try to spread disinformation perpetuated by sexist reactionaries.
* However, if you are well-versed in feminist theory, your supposed expertise does not excuse any attempts to deny or undermine gender-variance.

##Racism
----

Acknowledging queer issues of our time requires us to furthermore look to the intersection of queer issues with other social movements, identities, and societal oppression. r/lgbt is a space for all queer people. Since the beginning of our rights movement, there has been an ongoing issue with erasure and representation, exclusion from the community, and outright hostility towards queer people of color. As our community presses forward we have to learn from our mistakes, and leave no one behind. All the rules above should apply to race just as much as they should apply to gender, sex, sexuality, or romantic identities.
  
Furthermore, the issue of racial appropriation is common in the community. Some of the most important participants in the fight for queer rights were people of color, but our history has since been bleached. Furthermore, things like appropriating aspects from the Civil Rights movement serves to take credit for the movement at its own expense. LGBT rights are civil rights, but the LGBT Rights movement is not the Civil Rights movement. This is not so much a rule as a notice; if you are called out on being appropriative, please demonstrate a willingness to learn from your mistake.

##Body Shaming, ableism, and serophobia
----

Furthermore, please do not put down, shame, or insult people's bodies. Insulting and excluding someone for being fat, or hairy, or old, or anything like that, is in poor taste, especially in a subreddit like this where people come to escape harrassment for how they look or act. Do not shame someone for their gender expression. Insulting comments about people who are disabled or neuroatypical are also frowned upon. Everybody in this subreddit is a human being; please treat everyone as such. Serophobia is the manifestation of fear or aversion directed towards people living with HIV. Similarly, misleading or false information about HIV and AIDS is a bannable offense, as is advocating the continuation of discrimination against gay men donating blood.
