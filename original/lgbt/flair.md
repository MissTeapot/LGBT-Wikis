###3'rd party reddit apps

The ability to set flairs on a Subreddit varies wildly from App to App. We're unable at this time to provide a guide for specific apps, though you may have luck asking on the application's subreddit.

###Old Reddit

**Whilst it is possible to select a base flair on Old Reddit, we reccomend using New Reddit to set your flair.**

* look in the right-hand sidebar for "Show my flair in this subreddit. It looks like: {{ your username }}". It's a little small. If there is an [edit] button next to your username, click it to select your flair.
