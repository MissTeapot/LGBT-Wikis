# r/lgbt Minecraft Monthly Update - October 2020 Changelog

**Thursday, October 15th 2020.**

##Plugin Additions

* EmojiChat with DiscordSRV integration
* Player Heads
* More Mob Heads
* Universal Dyeing Pack
* TAB

##Rule Changes

**‘No Political Discussions’**

This Rule has been introduced following a lot of debate on the server about Politics, mainly surrounding Economic Ideologies. Our lives as LGBTQ+ people are intrinsically political, and we’re not banning discussion around Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia, etc. However, we are banning discussion of Political Parties, Political Ideologies, and Elections. 

Many of us use the r/lgbt Minecraft as an escape from the outside world where we’re constantly having to talk politics, and there have been public and private representations made to the Moderators calling for this rule to be added.

To be able to continue playing on the server, you will need to accept the New Rule by typing the command listed in the Update Room. You should automatically be teleported to the Update Room when you first log in after the update. 

Once you have agreed to the new rule, you will be able to use other commands as normal, to return to Home/Spawn.

##Chat Changes

We’ve shortened how world names appear in chat;

* [S] Survival Overworld
* [C] Creative
* [N] Nether
* [E] The End

We are continuing to work on a profile system to allow player options such as pronouns. We hope to roll this out in the November monthly update.

##PVP

As many of you know, we had to disable PVP recently following complaints. We still want to allow PVP, but in a controlled environment. So bpwpb and GrumpyOldDan built the PVP Arena at ‘/warp pvp’.

The idea is we'll have different tournaments, sometimes it may just be a 1v1, other times we'll try some team stuff, maybe some capture the flag type stuff, some platform duels and all sorts. We also plan to have co-op events where a team of players can try to survive waves of enemies

The PVP Arena will only be open when a Mod is available to supervise, to reduce disputes and arguments.

At the moment, we are not adding toggleable PVP, as it is our belief that this can be abused still. We want to see how the arena goes, and will continue to review what PVP options we allow.

##Next Update

The November Monthly Update is scheduled to take place on Thursday 19th November 2020.
