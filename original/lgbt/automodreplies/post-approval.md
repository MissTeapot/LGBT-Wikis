# Post and Comment Approval on r/lgbt

r/lgbt's team of Moderators from around the world work throughout the day to approve posts and comments that get filtered to our Moderation Queue. We have a lot of filters on r/lgbt to prevent abusive and harmful content reaching our subreddit. 

As a side-effect of this safety work, a lot of genuine posts and comments get caught as well. These genuine posts and comments, that meet the rules of the subreddit, will be approved when a Moderator gets to them in the Moderation queue. 

You do not need to message the Moderators asking for your post to be approved. Our team works around the clock to approve posts and comments that meet our rules. Messaging us will not speed up this approval process for your post or comment.

Please note, during times of high activity, or during brigades, we turn up our filters to make sure we're catching harmful content. There will likely be a delay in your post or comment being approved during this time, and posts or comments that normally wouldn't be filtered may be filtered.
