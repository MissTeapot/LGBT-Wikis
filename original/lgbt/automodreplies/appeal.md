# To appeal a r/lgbt Ban

Please check the rules of r/lgbt at https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/about/rules to see if the reason you were banned is included in the rules. 

If you still wish to appeal your ban, consult our [subreddit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/wiki/faq#wiki_did_you_break_the_rules.3F) for guidance. Make sure you are apologetic for your behavior, and demonstrate to us that you will follow the rules in future.

There may be an additional delay in handling appeals during times of high-demand.
