Asexuality is a sexual orientation where a person doesn't experience sexual attraction towards anyone. This is a place for asexuals, demisexuals, aromantics, gray-a's, questioning, supporters, folks just interested, and everyone in between.

Remember, be careful with what you share online and who you meet. This is a safe space for everyone, but that can't be enforced outside of this subreddit.

**1. No rudeness.**

No derogatory remarks or slurs. No racism, sexism, or other hate speech towards any group (asexual or otherwise). This is meant to be a safe and relaxing space – any submission that detracts from that may be removed.

**2. Certain posts are restricted to Mild Mondays.**

"Mild Mondays" run from 18:00 UTC on Sunday to 06:00 UTC on Tuesday. The following content should not be posted outside of Mild Mondays.

* Memes,
* common or repetitious jokes,
* objects with asexual colours that were not intended by the creator to symbolise asexuality.

Posts of the form "repost if...", "share if...", etc. are not allowed on any day of the week.

**3. Mark posts appropriately.**

The following content should be marked appropriately.

* **Aphobia**: Posts which are a screenshot or direct link to aphobia must have the "aphobia" flair and be marked as spoiler.
* **NSFW**: Posts containing NSFW written content must be marked as "NSFW".

In either case please do not put aphobia or NSFW details in the title of a post. If you need help assigning flairs / marking posts, please [contact a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasexuality).

**4. Advertising.**

Posts promoting items for reasons other than the benefit of the community will be removed.

**5. No bandwagoning**

Bandwagon posts are not permitted. That is, any content that may be acceptable in isolation but has formed part of a repetitive trend that generates many reposts with little variation. 

Posts with a “share if…” structure are never allowed, regardless of bandwagon status.
