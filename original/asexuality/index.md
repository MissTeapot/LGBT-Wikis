*Welcome to the r/asexuality wiki. This wiki is no longer maintained – instead all content has been migrated to a stand-alone website here: [https://www.asexuality-handbook.com/home.html](https://www.asexuality-handbook.com/home.html). For the most up-to-date version please go there, but you can still view the wiki as it originally appeared below.*

Asexuality is a sexual orientation where a person doesn't experience sexual attraction towards anyone. It's similar to how a heterosexual person does not experience sexual attraction to their own gender, but applied to everyone. Asexuality is also an umbrella term for people that fall between asexuality and other orientations.

The page [What is asexuality?](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/what_is_asexuality) provides an introductory overview of asexuality, as well as explaining what asexuality isn't. Several phenomena that are usually conflated with asexuality are discussed in more detail in [*The a-spectra*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/the_spectra). We have also compiled [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/faq), [definitions](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/definitions), advice, links and more, which you can find below. We trust that together these resources will help shed some much-needed light on an orientation that has stayed in the dark for far too long.
