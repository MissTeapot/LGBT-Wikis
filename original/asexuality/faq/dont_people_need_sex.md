#Don't people need sex? What about Maslow's hierarchy? 

[*Back to FAQ index.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/faq)

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is popular outside of academia but has always been contentious within it â€“ in particular the position of sex in the hierarchy has been heavily disputed from the very beginning. In any case, Maslow's hierarchy hasn't made any successful predictions, so it isn't really a scientific theory in the normal sense. Additionally, if someone tells you they're fine not having sex, you should just believe them.
