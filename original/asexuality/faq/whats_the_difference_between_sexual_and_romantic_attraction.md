#What's the difference between sexual and romantic attraction?

Despite often going together, sexual and romantic attraction are very different sensations. Sexual attraction is an urge to have sex with specific people. In contrast, romantic attraction refers to who you might form romantic relationships or fall in love with. Romantic relationships do not always involve sex: they may involve other kinds of physical or emotional intimacy.

You can find first-hand descriptions of what sexual attraction feels like on the page [*Expeirences: sexual attraction*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/experiences#wiki_sexual_attraction).
