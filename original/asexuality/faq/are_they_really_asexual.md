#Is my friend/partner really asexual?

If they say so, then yes. You should believe what people say about their own experience: they are the expert here. It's very hard for you or someone on the internet to answer this kind of question for a person. Erasure is one of the largest issues that asexuals face, so suggesting that what they're experiencing isn't real can be very harmful.
