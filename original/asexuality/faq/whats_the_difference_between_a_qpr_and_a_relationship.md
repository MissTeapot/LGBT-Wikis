#What's the difference between a QPR and a romantic (non-sexual) relationship?

A QPR is an intimate relationship that is the same as a standard relationship but without the romance and sex. Essentially a very close friendship where the parties agree to be committed to each other in the long term (e.g. living arrangements, family assimilation, etc.); and that is celebrated by society in the ways that a regular relationship is, perhaps with ceremonies and legal codes such as marriage, anniversaries, etc. The members of a QPR are called 'queer platonic partners' or 'platonic life partners'.

The key distinguishing difference between a QPR and a romantic relationship is that a QPR lack elements of romantic love. Romantic love may be considered to include "butterflies", a loss of appetite, an increased heart-rate, or even a feeling like the love can transcend space and time. (A much more in-depth description of romantic love is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/the_spectra#wiki_romantic_attraction); you can also find personal accounts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/experiences#wiki_romantic_attraction).)

At the end of the day there isn't a hard delimitation between QPRs and romantic relationships. An alternative way of thinking about QPRs is to say that they're about looking at the relationship 'from the other direction', or bending the rules about what a romantic or platonic relationship can be. Calling a relationship a QPR can be a convenient way of working from a different set of assumptions than the standard romantic ones.
