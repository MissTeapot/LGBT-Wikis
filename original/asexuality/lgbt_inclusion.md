#LGBT inclusion


[*Back to wiki main page.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/index)

-----

Similar to trans people, bisexuals, and others, asexuals are sometimes excluded from the broader LGBT community. This can take an overt from (e.g. LGBT people arguing that asexuals are 'straight' or don't belong in LGBT spaces) or a more subtle form where asexuals are marginalised by not having them or their specific needs recognised.

###Acceptance in mainstream LGBT communities

Despite what it might seem like online, the LGBT community as a whole is very accepting of asexuals. For example, according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/bwidmd/pride_month_reminder_exclusionists_are_a_minority/), approximately 95% of LGBT people think asexuals have a right to be a part of the community regardless of other facts (the figure was closer to 90% of aromantics). 

Additionally, as documented in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/bs6bew/weve_reached_40000_subs_lets_celebrate_by/), we have confirmed the explicit inclusive policies of the following organisations.

* r/lgbt
* GLAAD
* Galop
* The Trevor Project
* Camp Caterpillar
* Manchester Pride
* Gay Star News
* Advocate
* various students’ unions and local prides.

In particular, you may be interested in the following quotes.

* &gt; Thanks so kindly for contact us, we actually went off to have a great discussion about this and decided to rephrase rule 1 based off this so it now reads; No GSRM-phobic content (i.e homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism)
&gt; 
&gt; Ace is most definitely included as part of the community, as mods we are ultimately just people and do rely a lot on other users reporting content, we are disappointed that often Aphobic content is not reported as quickly as some other forms of phobic behavior, but the moment it is reported we will act on it. – r/lgbt moderation team after being asked if asexuals are welcome.

* &gt; [In response the a question about not being accepted:] It sounds like you are honestly and bravely sharing your feelings with the people you love and depend on, but that they aren’t hearing, understanding or validating you. That’s really tough, especially because having the support of family and friends can make such a huge difference as we’re discovering who we are. We want you to know that being asexual is completely valid and normal, and that you have our full support! – The Trevor Project a-spectrum FAQ.

* &gt; For the first time since GLAAD has started this report, there are asexual characters counted. Cable and streaming each include one asexual character, while there are none on broadcast. While the Jughead character is asexual in the Archie comics, The CW’s Archie series Riverdale is not yet telling this story. GLAAD would like to see the series address this moving forward, as the ace community remains nearly invisible in media. — GLAAD in the executive summary of their LGBTQ inclusion annual report 2018.

###Hetero-romantic asexuals

Hetero-romantics are more likely to face exclusion than other asexuals. However, hetero-romantic asexuals may still need protection from:

* corrective rape;
* medicalisation (or being told they are broken) by friends, family, and/or society;
* not being believed or called weird by friends, family, and/or society;
* fear and loneliness about the prospect of finding a suitable partner;
* being delegitimised or ignored by LGBT communities and/or policies.
