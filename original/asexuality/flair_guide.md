# Guide to r/asexuality flairs

[*Back to wiki main page.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/wiki/index)

-----

Flairs are the small tags that appear after a user's name. You can give yourself a flair and customise what it says (including adding flags). The method for getting / editing a flair is different depending on what platform you're using, as explained in the sections below.

##Available flags

We offer the following flags.

* asexuality
* aromanticism
* aromantic asexuality
* demisexuality
* demiromanticism
* grey-sexuality
* grey-romanticism
* aegosexuality
* cupiosexuality
* quoisexuality
* quoiromanticim
* bi
* pan
* rainbow
* lesbian
* trans
* agender
* non-binary

If you want a flag added to this list, simply message a moderator and we'll see what we can do. The asexuality spectrum flags in this list are shown below.

####Asexuality &amp; aromanticism

![](%%asexual%%)  ![](%%aromantic%%)

####Demisexuality &amp; demiromanticism

![](%%demisexual%%)  ![](%%demiromantic%%)

####Grey-sexuality &amp; grey-romanticism

![](%%grey-sexual%%)  ![](%%grey-romantic%%)

##How to get a flair

Note: if you're struggling with assigning your flair using the methods below, feel free to message a moderator who can assign one for you.

###Old Reddit

In the sidebar you should see a checkbox below the subscribe/unsubscribe button that says "show my flair on this subreddit". Check this box and press the edit button below it. This opens a dialogue that lets you choose which background colour you want. You can then edit the flair text to whatever you like using the text box. Press 'save' and you're good to go.

You can add flags into your flair as well. If you add the text :ace: to you flair, than that will appear as the asexuality flag. You can even use multiple flags at the same time (up to a maximum of 10), e.g. ":asexual: KoolKid :aromantic:" will render as the asexuality flag, then the text "KoolKid" then the aromantic flag.

The emoji codes for the currently available flags are as follows.

* :ace: – asexuality
* :aro: – aromanticism
* :aroace: – aromantic asexuality
* :demiace: – demisexuality
* :demiaro: – demiromanticism
* :greyace: – grey-sexuality
* :greyaro: – grey-romanticism
* :aego: – aegosexuality
* :cupio: – cupiosexuality
* :quoiace: – quoisexuality
* :quoiaro: – quoiromanticism
* :bi: – bi
* :pan: – pan
* :rainbow: – the general queer pride flag
* :les: – lesbian
* :trans: – transgender
* :agender: – agender
* :enby: – non-binary

###New Reddit

In the sidebar you should see a panel called "community details", at the bottom of which there's a button called "community options". Press this button and then press the pen/pencil icon in the user flair section. This opens a dialogue where you can select your preferred background colour, and then edit the text to whatever you like. Make sure the "show my user flair" box is ticked and press "apply".

To add a flag to your flair, simply click the emoji icon in the flair-text editing dialogue, and select the flag you want. You can add up to 10 flags.

###iOS App

Select the "..." icon in the top-right and choose "change user flair". This will open a dialogue listing the options for background colours. Press edit (top right), and then select the background colour you want. You can then change the text of the flair to whatever you want (it won't change it for anyone else, don't worry!). Using the emoji button you can add up to 10 flags of your choosing. Then select save/apply and you're good to go.

###Android App

Flags can be added to your flair by inserting one of the emoji codes listed in the 'Old Reddit' section. Alternatively, you can contact a moderator saying what flair you want, and we can assign it to you.

###Mobile web

Emoji in flairs are unfortunately not supported in the mobile version of the website – they will appear as the emoji codes listed in the Old Reddit section. If you nonetheless want your flair to have a flag on other platforms, you can contact a moderator who can assign one to you.
