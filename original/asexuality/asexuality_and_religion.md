#Asexuality and religion

Most religions do not have a clear stance on asexuality, due to it only recently coming into the public consciousness. Christianity traditionally reveres celibacy, and as such, contains some teachings that may be construed as supporting asexuals. In the Bible Jesus is quoted saying

&gt; For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others â€“ and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs to the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

and the apostle Paul is quoted saying

&gt; I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.

Each of quotes can be taken to support existence of asexuals and their part in God's plan. Regardless, some Christians claim that asexuals do not exist, saying that sexuality is a gift from God and a fundamental part of the human identity.

Studies have found no significant correlation between religion and asexuality, with asexuality occurring with equal prevalence in both religious and irreligious individuals. One study found a higher proportion of asexuals among Muslim respondents compared to Christian ones. Asexuality is also common among the clergy, likely because they are less likely to be put off by vows of chastity.
