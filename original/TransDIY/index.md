## Medical Guidelines

Standards, guidelines, or explainers made by healthcare professionals.

[A full list of guidelines is maintained by Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/articles/transfem-hormone-guidelines/)

### Major Guidelines

#### WPATH Standards of Care

The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care (SOC) (2022, currently version 8 and known as SOC8) are considered by many to be the go-to international guidelines and best practices for trans healthcare.

There is a free download in many languages here:

https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc

#### Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline

The Endocrine Society guidelines (2017) are the major consulted international guidelines on transgender hormone therapy:

https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2017-01658

#### UCSF Guidelines

The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) trans health guidelines (2016) are quality and thorough:

## Crash Course

[Crash course anatomy and physiology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGl2BujkPQ&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOAKed_MxxWBNaPno5h3Zs8) is a YouTube video series covering a college level introduction to human biology.

It's a great way to gain a basic general understanding of the human body, which is a great thing to have for self medicating.

The episodes on the endocrine system and reproductive system are especially relevant.

## Wikipedia Pages

Here are Wikipedia pages about relevant topics in trans HRT.

If you don't understand something, click through on the links or google it separately. Don't be afraid to look at the sources that are cited either. Use [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se) to view paywalled papers (check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) if that link doesn't work). Use [LibGen](http://libgen.is/) to download paywalled books (also check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis) if that link doesn't work).

[A guide for searching and getting access to raw medical research on Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/articles/research-trans-literature/)

## Searching Reddit

Reddit search is pretty terrible, so it's better to use google. You can search only specific sites using [Google's advanced search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search). For example, put `reddit.com/r/TransDIY` in the "site or domain" field to only search this subreddit.

Another more advanced way to search Reddit is using https://camas.unddit.com/

Be very skeptical about things you see posted on reddit. It's very useful as a starting point to find what exactly to research in the first place, but be sure to verify everything, *especially* if it seems obvious or common knowledge.

# Other

## Body Measurements

[A graph showing the distribution of body measurements by gender, and how most things scale with height](http://anthro.cs.uni-freiburg.de)

This isn't HRT specific, but it might help with dysphoria by allowing you to get an objective idea of your bone sizes compared to the male/female average for your height. Keep in mind that HRT can change your height by a couple inches.

## Simulators

### Injectable Estradiol Simulator by Transfeminine Science

https://transfemscience.org/misc/injectable-e2-simulator/

A simulator for estradiol levels with injectable estradiol esters like estradiol valerate

### Steroid Plotter

https://www.steroidplotter.com/

For testosterone and other anabolic steroids. Calculates and plots dose eliminated (not drug levels) based on literature-reported half-lives. It's extremely rough, so take with a large grain of salt.

### Half-Life Calculator

http://com.hemiola.com/half-life/

This is useful for understanding and reasoning about half-lives and drug accumulation.
