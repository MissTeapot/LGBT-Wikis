**About link flairs**

Since most articles are relevant only to specific countries it seems that it would be best if, when talking about legal changes or legal developments, the link is tagged with a flair that demonstrates the particular country/ies that this will affect. Currently, there are flairs for the USA, Canada, the UK, the EU, Australia and New Zealand, with an option of "Other" if the previous ones aren't applicable. Message the mods and we'll add more as the need arises!
