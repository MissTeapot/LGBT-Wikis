&gt;#**Some starter tips by** /u/fnvt for voice feminization  
  
&gt;* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a "break" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto   
  
&gt;* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your "head voice"  
&gt;* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to "throw" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly  
  
&gt;* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.  
  
&gt;* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

&gt;#**Some starter tips by** /u/Makecab for voice masculinization  
  
&gt;* Humming vowels. After some sirens to help loosen the voice, hum "mmmm" at a low pitch, then open your mouth to speak vowels, i.e. "Mmmm-may, mmmm-me, mmmm-my, mmmm-mo, mmmm-mu". I like this one for pitch: it helps you anchor your voice lower.  
  
&gt;* "Ng" sounds. In a low but comfortable pitch, sing "bing-bong, ding-dong, king-kong" with emphasis on the "ng" sounds. Once you're comfortable with that pitch, you can try going a semitone lower. After a week or so at a certain pitch, you can increase the difficulty by raising your chin to tilt your head back. This one is helpful for both pitch and resonance.
