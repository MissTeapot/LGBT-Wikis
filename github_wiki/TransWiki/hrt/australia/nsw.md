***ACON via [transhub](https://www.transhub.org.au/) have published a [list of doctors in NSW who will prescribe HRT](https://www.transhub.org.au/doctors).*** I update this wiki page with an extract of the information for each doctor on transhub (last update *7 January 2020*). The advantage of this wiki page is that it includes doctors not on the transhub list and that I have included reviews of doctors where I can find them. I recommend you look on both transhub and this page when searching for a doctor.

Note that ACON offers support for doctors helping the trans community so if your doctor is willing to learn more about supporting trans patients, HRT, or implants, please encourage them to make contact with ACON via a [link on the transhub doctor list page](https://www.transhub.org.au/join-doc-list).

ACON previously had a list of doctors on their own site, but their [Gender Affirming Doctor list](https://www.acon.org.au/who-we-are-here-for/tgd-people/#acons-gender-affirming-doctor-list) has moved over to transhub.

Some background on Transhub here

A lot of us are going to Dr Michelle Guttman-Jones as she was the first new doctor to do implants after Hayes retired and got a lot of attention. Dr Portia Predney followed shortly after. There are now many other doctors doing them, but few mentions of them online. If you do go to another doctor please post about your experience to help others in the community.
Dr Hayes started practicing again in 2021.

&amp;nbsp;
**Estrogen Implants**

Unlike Dr Hayes our current doctors are extremely reluctant to prescribe 200mg implants, and its not clear who does (see Dr Michelle Guttman-Jones(https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/. If they do then it would be on a case by case basis and if you hear of someone getting them it doesn't mean you will. There's some further information on implants [here].md)TransWiki/hrt/implants.
 
Some of the doctors on the transhub list say

* Prescribes estrogen implants
* Prescribes estrogen implants based on previous doses

I assume this means you've a lot more chance of getting over 100mg if you've already been on it. It *does not* mean that you are guaranteed to get the same dosage as before, as the doctor is legally responsible for what they prescribe and they will evaluate your health.

Some of the doctors require a psych letter if you want to start HRT with them, but if you're already on HRT they will continue to prescribe HRT without a letter (calling this informed consent). For example

* Starts hormones with letter from Endocrinologist and/or mental health provider
* Manages hormones using informed consent

This is informed consent for both starting an continuing HRT.

* Starts hormones using informed consent
* Manages hormones using informed consent

## Jonathan Hayes

Key details

* Does implants up to 200mg (after 3+ months on HRT)
* Endocrinologist
* Informed consent 18+
* Treats minors (with psychologist/psychiatrist and both parents approval)
* Does Telehealth, but as a specialist (not GP) its not covered by medicare so around $130 for standard cases (2022)
* North Shore Medical Centre, Suite 10-11 Level 5, 66 Pacific Highway, ***St Leonards***, NSW 2065, Tel: 04567 62 984
* ~~Suite 3, 20 Bungan Road, Mona Vale, NSW 2103~~
* w/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/jon-hayes

Retired in 2019 and back in April 2021. Same email and phone number. As he's a specialist you need a referral from a GP (you can go without a referral, but it will be expensive), and if you had an [indefintite referral](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/referring-and-requesting-medicare-services) from before he retired you'll need to get a new referral - you can't continue to use the old one.

His wait list in 2022 is very short (for an endo), a week or two.

Dr Hayes had 4000 trans patients before his retirment in 2019. This must have been the majority of trans patients in Sydney. Personally he's been the best doctor I've ever had.

He doesn't have an issues with neurodivergence people.

Dr Portia is another super trans friendly GP, and again I have met her and strongly recommend her. The women I know who have been to her have been *very* happy with their experience.

Implants are in the butt into the same locations as Hayes did. I believe she will also do them in the same place as Taylor Square if requested.

One of the ACON meeting organizers was the GP Dr Mihal Guttman-Jones in Newtown. They are a new GP and I expect they will be one of the major figures in trans medicine in Sydney in the years to come.

I've met them and strongly recommend them. They are super trans friendly, does informed consent, and has already started doing implants. I just wonder how long until their books are full.

You probably won't get implants at the higher levels that Hayes did it (you may have more luck with Dr Portia Predny), but they are also not super low like some. Dr Mihal Guttman-Jones is however very caring and serious about what they do.

They insert the same 3mm implants as Dr Hayes did, and into the same locations (ie no new scars), and also offers 4.5mm implants as these last a bit longer and are less likely to break in shipping.

Another doctor at the same practice does implants (Nyrie Dodd).

[According to her website](https://www.hollythegeepee.com/) ***Holly Inglis is no longer practicing in Sydney*** and has moved to Tasmania.

She posts occasionally in the Nova True Facebook group and is clearly supportive of transgender people. I expect she's a good choice for a doctor, except for the max 100mg implants.

* Taylor Square Private Clinic, 393 Bourke Street, ***Darlinghurst*** NSW 2010

Doctors on staff include Cathy Pell, Mathew Shields, Linda Dayan, Rachel Burdon, John Byrne, Terri Foran, Heidi Spillane, Louise Tomlins, Rick Franklin, and Wee-Sian Woon.

There's a number of doctors who treat trans people at Taylor Square. Some are more strict than others, but they are unified in their opposition to 200mg implants and high estrogen levels. They *will not* prescribe high levels like Hayes did and *will* drop you down to 400-500 pmol/L before giving you a 100 mg implant (vs 200mg). This will reduce the peak level and likely have a shorter time between implants (so probably more scarring). There's enough people been there now to be certain of this protocol. They want you under 800 pmol/L.

Taylor Square put implants into the groin (vs butt with Hayes), so if you've already had butt implants you'll end up with 4 scars instead of 2, and I'd guess bigger due the implant size. You'll also have the pleasure of being able to see them easily. Perhaps this explains why some women don't like implants.

Taylor Square will not implant using 3mm, or in the butt like Hayes did.

There's no room for negotiating with Taylor Square. Take it or leave it.

It appears that Dr Catherine Pell won't perform the implants herself, referring you to another doctor to do it.

My personal opinion is that Taylor Square should be avoided. Apart from the treatment itself I believe they have a negative influence on trans medicine in Sydney. While there are women happy with Taylor Square, it appears to be mainly those who have never been elsewhere. There are a *lot* of complaints about Taylor Square on the Facebook group. There are many better options.
