* https://www.queenslandjudgments.com.au/queensland-reports/judgments-selected-for-reporting/editors-note/356876 - 31 March 2022, [2022] QSC 159 - *"...his Honour considered whether it was appropriate to make a declaration that a child was competent to consent to the administration of stage 2 treatment for the condition called gender dysphoria. Relevantly,* ***only one of the child’s parents supported the child’s wishes*** *to undergo the treatment. His Honour held that undertaking the treatment was in the best interests of the child even though the Federal Circuit and Family Court also had jurisdiction..."*

However, unlike adults, a child or young person is presumed not to have the capacity to give their own consent, unless there is sufficient efidence they have such capacity. This is often referred to as Gillick competence. Where the young person can consent to their own treatment, neither court involvement nor parental consent is required..."*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillick_competence - *"Gillick competence is a term originating in England and Wales and is used in medical law to decide whether a child (a person under 16 years of age) is able to consent to their own medical treatment, without the need for parental permission or knowledge."*

By the end of the first appointment I felt very invalidated as she condescendingly told me that I shouldn't pursue the path of hrt and to lose weight instead. She didnt seem to understand non binary indentities very well (she misgendered me multiple times and my gf as well). I decided to go for a second appointment to see if she improves and nope. Based on the mental health quizzes that she sent me to do during the first appointment, she deemed me unfit to continue the hrt path. I didnt even score that high lmao.
