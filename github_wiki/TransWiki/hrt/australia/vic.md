* reply to [Experiences with TG Health Clinic](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderau/comments/ved2kx/experiences_with_tg_health_clinic/) by The2000thObserver in 2022 - *"Monash was pretty terrible if I'm being honest. It was supposed to be a 1 year wait list to get on HRT, but they lost my referal so for me it was actually 2 years. And once I finally got on HRT the dose they gave me was really bad, I didn't get many changes off it. And they also weren't checking my blood tests nearly as often as they should have been, so for a period of around 6 months my HRT dose was especially bad that it was causing health complications, and monash had no idea cause they weren't monitoring my hormone levels. I lost an unhealthy amount of weight during that time.
Also it felt like they refused to listen to me a lot of the time. It took me 6 months to convince them to put me on a t blocker. And a couple of times they forgot to refill my prescriptions and didnt respond when I tried to contact them about it. So a couple of times I didnt have any HRT left for a week or two."*

I waited for 15 mins until the Nurse/Sister arrived and explain the doctor is unwilling to aid as it was an ethical issue for him. The best part is the doctor is strongly apposed to anything LGBTQI related and vocal in public since then."*
