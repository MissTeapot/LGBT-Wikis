# Dependance

An occasional argument by doctors against implants and higher levels of estrogen is that its addictive.

**1992 [Drug dependence with oestrogen replacement therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1346294)**

 The first reference appears to be [Drug dependence with oestrogen replacement therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1346294) by Bewley and Bewley in 1992

&gt; Dependence on some drugs can be hard to recognise. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been widely prescribed only in the past two decades, and the indications for treatment and the risk/benefit ratio are still disputed. Oestrogens are psychoactive: they lift mood, can be given by injection, and their use has powerful psychological effects. Reports of women with supraphysiological oestradiol concentrations may represent tolerance and withdrawal. Dependence on substances occurring
naturally in the body has been reported before. *We propose that HRT dependence occurs.*

A number of *very* critical responses were made to this paper in Letters to the editor [Dependence and oestrogen replacement](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736(92\)91127-T/fulltext).

Whitehead and Stevenson respond

&gt; The authors postulate that oestradiol implants can be addictive because they have psychological benefits but may produce adverse effects-namely, a return of the unpleasant menopausal symptoms they relieved-when withdrawn. This idea can be applied to most, if not all, hormones. For example, insulin has effects on the brain and certainly causes unpleasant effects when withdrawn from an insulin-dependent diabetic. Readers can think up countless equally ludicrous examples.

&gt; We sympathise with our colleagues in psychiatry who, unwittingly, caused so much grief by inducing drug dependency with hypnotics and tranquillisers. We understand their desire to prevent a similar occurrence in another specialty. However, we do not welcome the effluent from public Macbethian hand-washing when it is directed, unreasonably, at HRT. We were taught that psychiatrists tried to relieve anxiety and panic - not cause them.

Jean Ginsburg, Paul Hardiman, and Stanley Okolo respond

&gt; That oestrogens (and testosterone) exert substantial effects on central-nervous-system activity and that they may elevate mood is well known but is this a disadvantage? Do the Bewleys prefer compounds with depressant effects? Would they deny testosterone to a hypoandrogenic male on the grounds that it would be difficult
for the individual, once he had appreciated the advantages of androgenicity, to stop treatment?

John Studd responds

&gt; I have no doubt that many patients formerly distressed by insomnia, fatigue, and depression (and antidepressants or the occasional episode of [electroconvulsive therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy)) are dependent on the good health they achieve when on effective HRT. Is this really a cause for concern?

**2009 [Estrogen Abuse: A case report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265281220_Estrogen_Abuse_A_case_report)**

This 2009 paper shows how the dependance idea works in practice.

&gt; We present the case of a 52 year old housewife with a psychiatric diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder who was prescribed *conjugated estrogen tablets* following surgery. The patient went on to develop withdrawal symptoms every time a taper of estrogen was attempted and began taking tablets on an "as and when" required basis. She was eventually managed with a combination of *[fluoxetine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine), [alprazolam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam)* and a thorough exploration and management of her knowledge and attitude towards her surgery as well as the hormonal medications.

&gt; ...On follow-up for the next 2 year, she *continued to remain well on 20 mg of [fluoxetine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine)*.

Its not clear to me how she could be considered to be addicted to estrogen, but not on the antidepressant fluoxetine which she was still taking two years later? Alprazolam is also a highly addictive benzodiazepine (Ait-Daoud 2018).

&gt; Alprazolam is one of the most widely prescribed benzodiazepines for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Its clinical use has been a point of contention as most addiction specialists consider it to be highly addictive

Her dependance on estrogen was viewed in the most negative light in terms of dependance and abuse, and there was no consideration of the risks of their treatment vs. that of remaining on estrogen.

Possibly worse, she was given *[conjugated estrogen tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_estrogens)* which was known at the time to be unsafe, while safe alternatives such [Estradiol Valerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol_valerate) have long been available.
