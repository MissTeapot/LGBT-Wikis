# Facebook

There's significant resources available on Facebook, especially in these Facebook groups. Note however the Facebook groups are significantly smaller than those on reddit. When I checked in May 2020 r/Transgender_Surgeries had 13563 members (r/asktransgender had 133k and r/MtF had 79k).

There are a few significant issues using Facebook

* Facebook is a black hole for knowlege. It goes in and disappears, lost to the community. Its difficult to search within Facebook, and impossible from outside.
* Facebook does not allow nsfw photos, severely limiting the kind of information you can find there.
* There's little privacy when using Facebook and its quite possible it will out you. Its very difficult to get around this if it concerns you.
* There appears to be a significant level of bias in the information on Facebook. Some of the surgeons that are popular there are very different to those that are talked about on reddit and other places. I suspect this is due to the way Facebook works, making it very susceptible to commercial manipulation and deceptive practices. It is very difficult for surgeons to do the same on reddit.

I have not linked any posts on Facebook, except in a very few cases where they have been shared publicly already.
