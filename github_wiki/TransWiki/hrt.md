# Resources on HRT

There's a lot of discussion/argument about the proper HRT protocol, to the point that its hard to work out what's correct. An article by Beverly Cosgrove nicely sums up the disagreement, [What Went Wrong With MTF Hormonal Therapy?](https://moderntranshormones.com/2017/10/16/what-went-wrong/).

## Manufacture of Injectable Estrogen

It can help to know what is in injectable estrogen as some people have problems with some formulations and changing to a different one may help, or a change in supplier may cause unexpected problems. A very few make their own injectable estrogen, although this kind of thing seems a lot more common in bodybuilding and there are numerous websites and suppliers dedicated to this purpose.

There are 4 main components

* Estrogen ester - usually estradiol valerate (EV)
* Carrier oil - perhaps Castor oil, Ethyl Oleate.
* Solvent - typically Benzyl Benzoate
* Antimicrobial/preservatives - typically Benzyl Alcohol

Reactions to the ingredients

* [Site reaction when injecting EV](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/sv7tkd/site_reaction_when_injecting_ev/) by art_usagi in 2022

### Estradiol Esters

Injectable Estradiol Valerate (EV) comes in various strengths, including 5, 10, 20, and 40mg/ml. The more concentrated it is the less needs to be injected to achieve the desired blood levels.

The interactive [Injectable Estradiol Simulator](https://transfemscience.org/misc/injectable-e2-simulator/)  on [Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/) shows idealized curves of estradiol levels after injection of different estradiol esters in women, and its quite fun playing with it.

Beverly Cosgrove describes a number of different injectable estrogens and their properties

* [Chart: Properties of HRT Estrogens](https://moderntranshormones.com/2017/11/16/chart-properties-of-hrt-estrogens/) in 2017
* [The Injectable Estradiol and Progesterone Shortages of 2018-2019](https://moderntranshormones.com/2018/05/06/the-injectable-estradiol-and-progesterone-shortages-of-2018/) in 2018

There are various different esters of estradiol, however due to availability and cost you may have not choice in what you can use. The different esters have different half-lives, leading to longer or shorter times between injections. Estradiol Valerate (EV) is typically injected every 5 days to minimize large (and unpleasant) swings in blood levels, but a few people inject more frequently if they still have modd swings. If your doctor wants you to inject every two weeks you should probably try to find a new doctor (or halve the amount and do it every week).

### Carrier Oils

Ii is possible to make a aqueous (water) injection rather than using an oil, but its difficult to find out much about it.

## DIY Compounding

Depending on country, injectable estrogen may be available from a pharmaceutical manufacturer or [compounding pharmacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compounding). A small minority of trans people DIY with HRT from online sources, and a tiny subset of those compound their own HRT. There seems to be vastly more men doing this for bodybuilding than there are trans women.

Subs with information on compounding

* r/estrogel
* r/TransDIY
* r/steroids - bodybuilding, but often discusses making injectable medicines
* r/SteroidsHomebrewing - bodybuilding, the wiki contains lots of interesting information
* The [wiki for r/steroids](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/homebrew/list) provides quite a lot of information on the (home) manufacture of body building steroids, and as far as I understand injectable estrogen uses quite similar processes. One important thing to note is that the various oils used to carry the estrogen have very different properties, and can cause negative reactions in some people - if you have a bad reaction to an injection it may simply to due to the carrier oil rather than the estrogen itself.

# Long Term Storage

Some people are concerned with long term supply of hormones and want to build a stock of hormones in case their supply gets cut off. Apart from obtaining the HRT the issue here is the shelf-life of pharmaceutical HRT is limited, and quite short.

Ultimately the only thing you can rely on is what's written on the label regarding shelf-life and storage conditions. Past that its guess work and you're taking a risk.

I don't have any expert knowledge of this, and I'm only reeating what others have said on reddit and other sites - don't trust me with your health.

Most drugs keep longer the lower the temperature – i.e. in the refrigerator or freezer, and freezing should slow down the oil going rancid. Note however, there are drugs that are damaged by cold. I would guess estradiol valerate tables last longer cold, but I don't know. Progesterone capsules with oil is perhaps not so good.

However injectable hormones will likely crystallise out of solution in the cold, becoming unusable unless you can get it to dissolve again - either at room temperature, heated in a water bath, or an autoclave. Higher concentrations of estradiol in oil are more difficult to dissolve. Note that injectable estrogens are, at least sometimes, sterilised at around 120C for short periods in an autoclave. Don't do that unless you know what you're doing. Freezing a bottle of water will break the bottle due to expansion when water turns to ice - it shouldn't happen with oil as the coefficient of thermal expansion is small. Heating a vial in an over can burst the cap due to the increase in internal pressure, hence the autoclave (according to what I've ready in DIY compounding forums).

Lena of DIY fame says her injectable estrogen have a 5-year shelf-life, limited by the oil going rancid. This is far longer than pharmaceutical vials of estrogen. I don't know how you can tell if the oil is rancid or the vial has become dangerous (or more dangerous since this is homemade).

Patches lose their stickiness when very old, speaking from personal experience. 

Raw estradiol/estradiol valerate powder probably has a very long shelf-life, especially when stored below zero. I would assume if you compound your own HRT (e.g. pills, gel, injections) this could last decades (and very cheap). Obviously there's additional health and possibly legal risks doing this and very few do. There's relevant links elsewhere on this page.

Some people are prescribed injectable estrogen in a vial that lasts 1 month after the first injection. Some build a stock of vials by using the vial until its finished (which is far longer than a month), not telling the doctor, keep the excess vials of estrogen, and always use the oldest vial first. These vials should probably contain antimicrobial or preservative chemicals, typically Benzyl Alcohol, but they probably do with a life of 1 month. There will still be a limit to the life as the oil will eventually go rancid.

Vincent writes about how the only time she has ever been considered excessively feminine was during her stint as a man: her alter ego, Ned, was assumed to be gay on several occasions, and features which in her as a woman had been seen as "butch" became oddly effeminate when seen in a man. Vincent asserts that, since the experiment, she has more fully realized the benefits of being female and the disadvantages of being male, stating, "I really like being a woman. ... I like it more now because I think it's more of a privilege." She's also stated that she has gained more sympathy for and understanding of men and the male condition. ... Vincent's book* ***Voluntary Madness*** *is about her experiences as an inpatient in a mental hospital. Suffering from depression after her eighteen months living disguised as a man, she felt she was a danger to herself. On the advice of her psychologist she committed herself to a mental institution. Vincent spent time in three institutions – one urban, public and ill-funded; one small-town; and one private and expensive. She found some parts of the mental health care system beset by arrogant doctors and over-reliance on drugs as therapy, while others addressed merely the symptoms instead of their underlying causes.

# Cis Women HRT

Some cis-women require HRT and suffer many of the as trans-women - both medically and in access to treatment.

Cis women take HRT many reasons

* [Surgical menopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause#Surgical_menopause)
* [Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_dysphoric_disorder) (PMDD) is a hormone related problem some cis-women suffer from, and the there appears to be some overlap in the issues faced by both communities - in particular severe psychological issues and difficulty accessing appropriate medical treatment.


As doctors who are experienced in cis and trans women's HRT have similar skills (both may use implants for example), I intend to include information relevant to cis-women who use HRT here.

# Puberty Blockers

https://transfemscience.org/articles/puberty-blockers - *"Puberty blockers are medications used to pause puberty in both cisgender and transgender youth. For the latter, significant evidence suggests that they improve well-being, psychological functioning, and risk of suicidality, both during puberty and in later life. Their effects are reversible upon discontinuation. ..."*

# Ethinyl Estradiol

There are still some doctors who prescribe Ethinyl Estradiol and it's available in birth control pills such as [Microgynon 30](https://www.nps.org.au/medicine-finder/microgynon-30-ed-tablets), [Microgynon 50](https://www.nps.org.au/medicine-finder/microgynon-50-ed-tablets). While it works its unnecessarily dangerous and should be avoided if at all possible.


It has long been known that Ethinyl Estradiol raises the risk of blood clots. The Endocrine Society's 2017 paper "Endocrine Treatment of Transsexual Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline" refers back to a 1997 Dutch paper. The same advice is in their earlier 2009 guideline.

* *"Venous thromboembolism may be a serious complication. A20-fold increase in venous thromboembolic disease was reported in a large cohort of Dutch transsexual subjects. This increase may have been associated with the use of ethinyl estradiol. The incidence decreased upon cessation of the administration of ethinyl estradiol."*

An update to the referenced Dutch Study in 2011 "A long-term follow-up study of mortality in transsexuals receiving treatment with cross-sex hormones" in the European Journal of Endocrinology says

* *"Until* ***1989,*** *mainly ethinyl estradiol was prescribed in a dose of 100 mg/day, and only small numbers of patients used estrogen injections or other oral estrogen compounds, such as conjugated estrogens. But after publication of an elevated risk of venous thrombosis associated with ethinyl estradiol use (5), particularly in patients over 40 years of age, we
started to recommend transdermal E2 to all MtF, particularly to those over 40 years of age."*
* *"Moreover,* ***long-term ethinyl estradiol use was independently associated with a threefold increased risk of cardiovascular death.*** *Our findings in 1989 (5) of an increased incidence of venous thrombosis associated with the use of ethinyl estradiol had already led to a change in type of estrogen prescription for new patients starting cross-sex hormones, and nowadays only few MtF use ethinyl estradiol or other oral estrogens in high dose. The increased risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed only in those who were still using ethinyl estradiol. No increased risk was found in former users who had changed to other formulations and lower doses of estradiol. This is reassuring for those who have changed to other estrogen preparations."*
* *"In line with the Endocrine Society’s Clinical practice guidelines on Endocrine Treatment of Transsexual Persons (25),* ***we strongly recommend not to prescribe ethinyl estradiol*** *or OC, often self administered in higher dosages) to MtF transsexuals. Transdermal and low dose oral estradiol combined with anti-androgens are effective with fewer side effects in our experience and as published by others (26, 27). Consequently, since ethinyl estradiol is no longer used in our clinic since 2001, there is no indication to routinely test asymptomatic MtF before initiation of cross-sex therapy for (inherited) forms of thrombophilia (27), as long as the subject’s history does not suggest any additional risk (25)."*

In the 2008 paper [Long-term treatment of transsexuals with cross-sex hormones: extensive personal experience.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986639) *"Regarding morbidity, with ethinyl estradiol, there was a* ***6-8% incidence of venous thrombosis,*** *which is no longer the case with use of other types of estrogens."*

More recently, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, [Care of the Transgender Patient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261405) in 2019

&gt; The Endocrine Society guidelines recommend against use of ethinyl estradiol because data suggest that it is especially thrombogenic.


https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/prescribing-for-transgender-patients

* *"Ethinylestradiol and conjugated equine estrogens are generally avoided. They have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and measurement of their blood concentrations is inaccurate."*

The reference to conjugated equine estrogens means [Premarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_estrogens). The last I heard of that in Australia was more than 10 years ago at Taylor Square, and I don't think they prescribe it anymore.

The [WPATH Standards Of Care](https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc) state

&gt; Use of oral estrogen, and specifically ethinyl estradiol, appears to increase the risk of VTE. Because of this safety concern, ***ethinyl estradiol is not recommended*** for feminizing hormone therapy.

# Testosterone

Testosterone is a [Schedule III controlled substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act) in the USA (and much the same elsewhere) and there are serious penalties for getting possesion without caught with it without a prescription, or worse, selling it.

&gt; After a series of scandals and publicity in the 1980s (such as Ben Johnson's improved performance at the 1988 Summer Olympics), prohibitions of AAS use were renewed or strengthened by many sports organizations. Testosterone and other AAS were designated a "controlled substance" by the United States Congress in 1990, with the Anabolic Steroid Control Act.
