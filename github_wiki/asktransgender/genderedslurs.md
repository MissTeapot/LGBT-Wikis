# What are Gendered Slurs?#

Slurs that are, or have been, commonly or notably used to refer to members of a given sexual minority, gender, sex, or sexual orientation in a derogatory or pejorative manner.

## Common Gendered Slurs 
 * **This list is not exhaustive:** *bitch, cunt, pussy, twat, whore, slut, strumpet, trollop, dick, prick, manchild, manlet, mangina, faggot, homo, trap, tranny, ladyboy, shemale, etc.* 

## Are there any acceptable usages?

* **Quoting** – *they said, "You're a faggot"*
* **Body Parts** – *"it's my pussy"*
* **Common Phrase** – *"Slut shaming."*
* **Discusion** – *"My coworker called me a 'tranny'. What can I do about it?"*

## When are Gendered Slurs not okay?
* **They don't fall under the acceptable usages**
* **b****** – *The meaning is still there*
* **Reclaiming** – *What matters is how it's read, no one knows your intent.*
* **Literary effect** – *Emphasis, or decrying it's usage, it's still degrading and unnecessary.*   
* **Jokes** – *No. Not about yourself, not about someone else, not about an object.*
* **Inapplicable quotation** – *You're a "dick".*

## What about other slurs?

* As long as they aren't gendered, or being used to personally attack someone else, then they're fine.  **Some examples:** *fuck, shit, piss, asshole, damnit, etc.*
