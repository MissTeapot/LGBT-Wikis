# Rules

* Be acquainted with the [reddit user agreement](/help/useragreement), [privacy policy](/help/privacypolicy), and [reddiquette](/help/reddiquette) as a function of participation on reddit, these provide solid guidelines for 95% of both moderation and content issues.

* [Minors **under the age of 13** are not allowed on reddit.](/wiki/privacypolicy#wiki_children_under_13) We are required to report members identifying as such to the reddit admins.

## How to post:

* **Post titles should include a question.** 
We prefer that titles be in the form of a question, but if this is not possible, please make sure either the post title or content provides a starting point for discussion? -- **Use inclusive language** e.g. Not *"how did you ladies choose a female name?"* but instead *"how did you find your new name?"*

* **No bigotry.** No transphobia, sexism, racism, etc. No hateful speech or disrespectful commentary. This is so we can keep our subreddit *"Open to anyone with a question.”*

* **No personal attacks.** Don't attack each other, or the person asking the question. 

* **No gendered slurs.** [What are Gendered Slurs?](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderedslurs)

* **No invalidation.** Telling someone how they should feel, debating their lived experience, denying their identity, etc. [What is Invalidation?](/r/asktransgender/wiki/invalidation)

* **No gender policing or generalizations of gender.** e.g. “Real women are....” or  “All men are....”. [What is Gender Policing?](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderpolicing)

## What you post:

* **Be Relevant.** Your comments should be relevant to the question. If not, please make a new post or discuss it via PM’s.

* **No stirring the pot.** Please do not post threads that intentionally create drama, target a different sub or link to threads in a different sub (i.e. incite brigading).

* **No personal agendas.** /r/asktransgender is a place for discussion and is not a soapbox. If a post or comment indicates a personal agenda, or if it's clear they have not come here with an open mind, their post(s) will be removed.

* **Please [contact the moderating team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasktransgender) if you plan on posting a questionnaire, survey, promotion, or advertisement**. We'd like to review it before it is posted.

## Rules about links:

* **Links to other subreddits must link to a post.**

* **Links must be accompanied by a summary.**

* **Link /r/asktransgender only for educational and/or informational purposes.** Safety and privacy are important in our community, please do not link to or from other communities for the purpose of creating drama, harassing users, or inciting a war between communities.

* **No posting personal photos for feedback.**  Post instead to subreddits that give feedback on appearance. 

# Important Considerations

* **Proper pronoun usage is very important here.** Many of our posters are questioning and it can be affirming to be gendered correctly. If in doubt you can always ask.

* **Set your flair for visibility.** Flair has been provided for everyone. Note, you can also add text to your flair if you'd like to convey anything else you feel might be important.

* **Beware of triggers.**  We want everyone here to feel safe and welcome. Take a little time to understand where we're coming from and help us make this a supportive environment.
