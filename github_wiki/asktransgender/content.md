General participation guidelines
---

A large and ponderous rule set in very specific situation such as this (a subset of a larger whole with its own ruleset, focused around a specific topic) is off putting to many and destructive to participation(and freedom in general). However, to facilitate the free exchange of information here, a few rules are necessary. These rules are open to discussion and revision.

- Be acquainted with the [reddit user agreement](http://reddit.com/help/useragreement), [privacy policy](http://reddit.com/help/privacypolicy), and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) as a function of participation on reddit, these provide solid guidelines for 95% of both moderation and content issues.


Participation guidelines specific to /r/asktransgender:
---

- This is an inclusive and diverse space for all transgender individuals. We may be a different gender, have different goals in transition, live in another country, or have lower income, among many other things. Please consider this when creating posts or making comments so as not to make assumptions about others.

- Avoid condescending and derogatory language. This is a free-speech but avid racism, sexism, and other ism-ing

- Do not post porn, or provide links that service the porn industry directly or indirectly. You can post relevant nsfw content if marked as nsfw, but be aware of the preceding. A corollary of this is no soliciting -- of a sexual(or otherwise) nature.

- Do not post personal identifying information, not about you not about anyone you know e.g. addresses, phone numbers, age in post title, etc

- Flag your post as NSFW if you will be discussing or asking about material that could potentially not safe for people viewing in work environments.

- The ()[/trigger] syntax is available in your markdown for material with the potential to upset.

- Provide sufficient, but not unecessary information for your posts. Post titles should provide enough information so that other users can determine if they are able to provide an answer. Avoid posting your address, your age, and other specific information about yourself that might attract undue attention. Answers to a question about getting on HRT, for example, are going to depend on a variety of factors. Your general location can be useful for getting specific answers to your questions, as resources may vary from country to country. **Keep in mind, you are not required by anyone to reveal your location (or any other details about yourself you are uncomfortable in sharing), and in many cases specific details about yourself and life situation may be unecessary toward getting answers to your questions.**

- Do not post asking for funding or donations, or link to any site concerned with funding and/or donations to individuals.

- Avoid 'cross-posting'. Do not put 'x-posted from :subreddit:', or any similar variation linking to another subredit post in your title.


Medical Advice
---

- Please be sure to read over the [reddit user agreement](http://reddit.com/help/useragreement) again before dispensing any sort of medical advice, focusing on  disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, governing law, &amp; severability and enforcement and understand how this applies to you and your participation on reddit.

- Medical topics are not forbidden, but be aware of the limitation of taking and giving random advice to and from strangers on the internet. If you are suggesting self-medication, you need to provide substantial support for your claims, and similarly be aware of the benefits and dangers when taking such advice.

- While you are free to discuss issues surrounding medication and self-medication, do not post links to organizations or storefronts focused on selling pharmaceuticals.
