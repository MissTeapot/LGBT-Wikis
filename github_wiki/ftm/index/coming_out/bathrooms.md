## How can I begin to use men’s public bathrooms?

First, understand that the general etiquette of men’s public bathrooms is quite different from the stereotype of women being very chatty in bathrooms. Generally, men only go to the bathroom to do their business, wash their hands, and leave. Men are less likely to talk or to make eye contact while in the bathroom than women. In a way, this culture of silence works to your advantage. If a guy’s not even looking at you, then there’s no chance he’ll start to think you don’t belong in the bathroom. 

Beginning to use men’s bathrooms can be a source of anxiety. If you feel safe and up to the challenge, you can start using men’s bathrooms even before you are on T, or before you are passing consistently as male.

**Not passing consistently?** When you aren’t being read as male 100% of the time, it can be difficult to use any gendered bathroom. You don’t know if females are going to read you as male, or if males are going to read you as female. But if you start slowly transitioning into male bathrooms it can make your life easier. 

To begin, you may want to ease into using the men’s bathrooms gradually and still use single-stall or women’s bathrooms for some of the time. You can start off by only using the men’s if a) the area is not crowded and b) it’s a safe environment (ex. a trans-positive space). Whether you use an STP (stand-to-pee) device or sit down, start by using a stall. As you get more comfortable and gain confidence, build up to using the men’s more and more often. Eventually, you’ll be able to use the men’s room when it’s somewhat busy, and ultimately use it all of the time without much hesitation. Proceed slowly so as not to overwhelm yourself or to enter a situation that feels unsafe to you. Keep in mind that you can always use a single-stall or women’s bathroom if you want; it’s not a “step back” in your transition, and you’re still a man.

**Passing consistently?** If you’re passing most or all of the time, maybe you’re starting to be called out for using women’s bathrooms. You're probably thinking it’s time to switch to the men’s room. Have some confidence--you’re a guy, just like all the others as far as they’re concerned, and this is your bathroom too. Whether you use an STP (stand-to-pee) device or sit down, start by using a stall. Once you are comfortable with the general routine, you can begin using a urinal, provided you are confident you can do it without any accidents. 

Remember to take baby steps. Don’t push yourself to do something you don’t want to do. If you never want to use an STP, that’s completely fine. You don’t have to use a urinal either. Plenty of men, both cis and trans, prefer the stall for its privacy or because they sit down.

## What are my options for stand-to-pee (STP) devices?

All STP devices work by the same principle: you hold a receptacle over your urethra, and your urine is guided through a hollow tube. However, you may find that a certain style of receptacle works best for your anatomy. 

When using public urinals, you may be worried about your STP device standing out to other men. Packer-STPs which look like penises are available, but not always necessary. Some trans men use non-packer STPs in public urinals on a daily basis without any trouble. This reflects the tendency of men to keep to themselves and look straight ahead while using the bathroom. As long as your device isn’t neon green, most likely nobody will even notice. If you’re worried about your device standing out, use your free hand to shield it from view.
