## What are the different types of bottom surgery?

There are two main types of bottom surgery:

* **Phalloplasty**, where the penis is created from donor skin on another part of the body.

* **Metoidioplasty**, where the naturally present phallus (“clitoris”), after being enlarged from testosterone, is freed from surrounding tissues to create a more apparent penis.
 
There are numerous additional procedures that can be done together with phalloplasty or metoidioplasty:

* Urethroplasty, the creation of a urethra which allows you to urinate through the newly formed penis. The urethra is a tube of tissue constructed by a graft from the vagina, buccal mucosa (the inner lining of the mouth), or another place.

* Centurion, a variant of metoidioplasty which moves the round ligaments of the labia into the penis shaft. This technique was developed to increase the girth of the resulting penis.

* Scrotoplasty, the creation of a scrotum from labial skin.

* Testicular implants, which may be inserted directly or tissue expanders used first.

* Colpectomy (aka vaginectomy), colpoplasty (aka vaginoplasty), or colpoclesis: the removal of part or all of the vagina.

* Mons liposuction, the removal of fat from the area above the genitals. This may be done to make the penis more visible.

* Mons resection, similar to a “tummy tuck”, for similar reasons to mons liposuction.

* Thigh liposuction, the removal of fat from the inner or outer thighs. This may be done to give the penis and scrotum more room, and/or make them more visible.

## I've heard that bottom surgery is not really worth it for trans men. Is that true?

Only you can decide whether bottom surgery is worth it for you. There are widespread negative rumors and misinformation surrounding bottom surgery, especially phalloplasty. You need to consider what specific things you want out of the surgery, and what costs and risks you’re willing to take. Then look at reputable sources (some are listed above) and speak with potential surgeons in order to decide what procedure to have, if any.

When considering bottom surgery, here are some factors that might be important to you:

* Length, girth, and appearance of the resulting penis

* Ability to urinate from the penis standing up

* Ability to have an erection

* Ability to have a spontaneous erection (i.e. from blood flow alone)

* Tactile sensation

* Erotic sensation

* Ability to orgasm from stimulating the penis

* Ability to orgasm by other means (e.g. from vaginal penetration)

* Ability to penetrate a partner

* Retention of vagina and other parts you may have before surgery

* Scarring in the genital area

* Cost of surgery, both primary and collateral, and whether you have insurance coverage

* Travel considerations - language barriers, flight time, customs,

* Recovery time(s)

* Number of separate operations required

* Risk of complications, both short-term and long-term

* Functional and aesthetic damage to the donor site (for urethroplasty and phalloplasty)

* Tattoos or scarring on the donor site (e.g. scarring from abdominal hysterectomy) 

* Health conditions that restrict you from getting a certain procedure

### Satisfaction with Bottom Surgery

For people who elect to have bottom surgery, the satisfaction rates are relatively high. 

* [Average self-rated satisfaction for phalloplasty (various techniques) is 9/10.](http://www.amepc.org/tau/article/view/3748/4674)

* [193 of 207 metoidioplasty patients (93%) are satisfied with their overall outcome.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23444841) More reading [here](http://www.femaletomale.org/female-to-male-surgery/metoidioplasty/#results).

* Compare with vaginoplasty outcomes for trans women: [Average self-rated aesthetic outcome was 7.9/10 and functional outcome was 7.7/10.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25817066) More reading [here](http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pubmed/25817066).

No trans person should take these satisfaction rates as a predictor of their own experience. Make it a personal decision. Most people who have these surgeries are self-selected and 'fought' to have them because they had strong feelings that it would satisfy them. Those who thought lower surgery wasn't for them, would not bother with the lengthy and complicated surgical process. 


## Guidelines for Discussing Bottom Surgery

We discuss bottom surgery fairly often in this subreddit. It is important to be inclusive and respectful in all conversations, but it might be particularly difficult in conversations about bottom surgery because we are not sure of the terminology and the boundaries to go by. The following guidelines were created to facilitate those conversations.

1. When discussing photos or accounts of bottom surgery results, remember that every "result" belongs to an actual person, a person who's been through a lot to get where they are. You can speak honestly while still being respectful when talking about peoples' bodies. Some people will share photos just for the sake of others who are considering a similar path. Don't give unsolicited criticism.
&gt; **Bad:** Talking about whether penises look/are "normal", "real", "cis", or "functioning"
&gt; **Good:** Recognizing that all penises are real penises. Using more specific terms like "average-sized" or "spontaneous erections".

2. Some of our community members have had bottom surgery and are happy to share some of their experiences. Respect their right to disclose as much or as little as they want. 
&gt; **Good:** "If you don't mind sharing, how has your bottom surgery affected your sex life? If that's not something you want to share then that's okay, I'm just asking because sex life is something I'm particularly concerned about."

3. Respect individual differences. Some prefer a certain surgical technique over another; there is no "perfect". Some folks are not currently interested in bottom surgery for various reasons. These perspectives are all valid, so speak for yourself rather than in generalizations.
&gt; **Bad:** "None of the bottom surgeries are any good. They don't look like real/cis penises and they don't work."
&gt; **Good:** "I'm not planning to have bottom surgery because I'm not interested in the available techniques. To be specific, I don't like the scarring of the donor site."
&gt;**Bad:** "I'm definitely having bottom surgery, because I'm 100% really male."
&gt;**Good:** "I want bottom surgery but I know that some trans guys don't and that's totally cool."

4. Don't treat people like encyclopedias. Community members may be able to advise or provide resources for some general bottom surgery questions, but we do not have all the answers. In some cases you must do your own research online and/or by consulting with surgeons, especially if you are moving forward with the surgical process.
