# Coming Out

## To Family
***
***How do I tell my family that I’m trans?***

If you have trouble actually saying the words to your family, then consider telling them through a letter or an email. This way you can get down all your thoughts and feelings, while also having the advantage of proofreading it and making sure haven’t forgotten anything. It also means that you won’t say anything you don’t mean if your family’s reaction is not positive. If you write an email, you can also include links to resources that will help your family understand what you’re going through.

Be sure to think about how your family will receive this information, and tailor your coming out to your family in a way that will be safe for everyone involved. You might want to talk to each member of your family individually rather than as an entire group so you can have more intimate and honest conversations. On the other hand, it can be emotionally difficult to have the same conversation multiple times. If you tell your family together as a group, you can get through the conversation more quickly, but if there are negative reactions you may feel like they are ganging up on you.

If you are fairly certain your family will have a negative reaction, and you are dependent on them in some way (financial, living at home), be very careful in how and when you choose to come out. Prioritize your own safety. Consider coming out after you’ve saved enough money that you could move out if you had to. If you feel that your housing situation may be on the line, ask a friend to let you stay at their place for a while, just in case.

***I came out to my family and the reaction was not positive. What can I do?***

How long did it take for you yourself to accept who you are? Other people may take as long, or longer, to accept you in this new identity that you’ve shared with them. Give them time to absorb and process this change. Some family members might appreciate if you didn’t even talk about it for some time, to let them think on their own.

If your family acts like nothing even happened, wait for a good moment to bring it up again. Think of it as checking in with them to see how they’re dealing with it. This is a good time to offer resources about being transgender and gender variance. If they agree to look at the resources, ask if they would like you to look at them with you. Encourage them to ask questions. 

Patience is essential in the coming out process. If your family continues to be unable to accept you, don’t give up hope. Smile and tell them that you understand that they need more time to adjust, and that you’re there for them if they have any questions. 

It is important not to overload your family and friends with information or demands. They are undergoing a learning process, just as you are. It is certainly upsetting to to not be accepted by people you love. This is a feeling that all of us on /r/ftm know to some degree, and we would be happy to hear about or help with your family acceptance process. Also see [threads about family on /r/ftm](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=family&amp;restrict_sr=1).

There is a fine line between your family having difficulty accepting your identity, and your family abusing you. If your family members become emotionally or physically abusive towards you, and you are unable to resolve it, consider moving out  or going no contact for a while. If you have to move out, can find your own place, stay with a friend, or stay at a shelter. Family, especially parents, can take years to adjust to a gender transition in the family. Some trans men eventually drop contact with their family and never look back. You must decide for yourself. For some people there is no changing their minds, and it is in your best interests not to be around those people.

***
***My family has difficulty using my preferred name and pronouns. What can I do?***

It might sound rude, but correct them. When they use the wrong pronouns or name, give a friendly reminder like, “Mom it’s X now, remember?” Smile and show that you would really appreciate their support. Although anger may come quite naturally to you when you are misgendered or called by the wrong name, patience and constructive criticism are much more effective.

People can take a long time, sometimes years, to adjust to a new name and pronouns. If your family persistently refers to you incorrectly, even when you remind them, you may want to try a different strategy. Another strategy is to simply not answer to the wrong name or pronouns. Your mileage may vary.

## To Significant Other

***
***What’s going to happen with my relationship as I transition?***

If both of you exercise patience, understanding, and good communication, then hopefully your relationship will remain strong through your transition. However, it is important to remember that your partner has a sexuality, so if they consider themselves only attracted to females their attraction to you may change. It is also possible for your own sexuality, and your attraction to your partner, to change as you transition. For example, if you’ve always been attracted to only males, that may continue as you transition, or it may change to some degree. Throughout your coming out and transition process, it is important to continually communicate with your partner. They are going through this transition with you, so it’s going to be hard for them too. 

***
***How can I help my significant other understand and cope with my transition?***
    
Remember that while you’ve been thinking about your gender identity for a long time, it's still relatively new to your partner So be patient with them as they come to terms with your new self; give them time to process. Provide them with resources, particularly the ones aimed for partners of trans people:

## At School

***
***I’m in high school or younger. How do I transition at school?***

When you are under 18, it is easiest to transition at school with parent/guardian support. You and your legal guardian can meet with your school administrators to explain that you are transitioning, and have them change your gender and name in the school database. At this time you will also discuss how you’ll come out to your peers and teachers, and how you will handle sex-segregated areas (bathrooms, changing rooms, sports teams) if applicable. You may want to contact your teachers ahead of time to inform them of your situation and your preferred name and pronouns. Here is a [sample letter for coming out to teachers in high school](http://theartoftransliness.com/post/94632454196/we-received-this-anonymous-submission-that)

If you do not have parent/guardian support, there are still steps you can take to socially transitioning at school. You can go by a different name and pronouns at school while keeping the legal name that your parents see on report cards. Most school databases will have a spot on file for “preferred name”, to be printed on roster lists, separate from “legal name”. Speak to your school administrators to see if they would be willing to uphold some level of confidentiality between your school life and your parents. If you take this route, make sure you have a backup plan in case your parents find out and react negatively. Speak to a friend about staying with them for a short while in the event that your parents find out and throw you out of home. Speak to a supportive teacher or guidance counsellor about keeping your in-school transition secret from your parents for your safety.

***
***I’m in college or university. How do I transition while in school?***

Social transition can be much easier in college/university compared to high school, especially if you’re just about to enter at a new school. When you’re meeting people for the first time it’s easier to introduce yourself as your preferred name and introduce yourself without old, preconceived notions about you.

You can contact student services and ask if you can use your preferred name instead of your legal name on class lists and student ID cards. Most schools won’t officially change your name without proof of a name change. Before class begins, you may want to email all teaching staff that you’ll come in contact with to inform them of your preferred name and pronouns. Here is a [sample letter for coming out to course instructors](http://theartoftransliness.com/post/94577081713/do-you-guys-have-any-templates-for-emailing).

***
***What are my rights as a trans student?***

This depends a lot on where you go to school. Your first step is to find out whether your school or school district has any policy laid out for accommodating trans students. In some high schools and many colleges and universities you will find a LGBT student organization. Try contacting them for information and advocacy specific to your region. If you feel your rights have been violated, you may consider taking legal action against your school. But it is always wise to try to resolve the issue in other ways first—talk to your school administrators and see if you can negotiate a solution.

**Canada**: Your province may or may not have a human rights code protecting you against discrimination from educational institutions. [Ontario](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/gender-identity-and-gender-expression-brochure), for example, includes gender identity and gender expression as protected grounds. Whether or not gender identity is specifically included in your province’s human rights code, you can still [file a complaint](https://www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/eng/content/what-discrimination) if you feel you have been discriminated against. Get in touch with your local LGBT community for support on this process.

**USA**: Some law varies by state, but Title IX is a federal law that prohibits exclusion on the basis of sex in any publicly funded education program. The 2013 [Student v. Arcadia Unified School District case](http://www.nclrights.org/cases-and-policy/cases-and-advocacy/student-v-arcadia-unified-school-district/) set the precedent that gender identity is included in this law. For more information on your rights, discrimination, and filing and complaint, see [here](https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/schools). For a legal information helpline, contact [Transgender Law Center](http://transgenderlawcenter.org/help). 

**United Kingdom**:  You are protected in all instances against discrimination in schools. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975: unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sex in education. Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999, revision April 2008: protects against discrimination against those who intend, or have undergone gender reassignment. The Equality Act 2006, Gender Equality Duty: makes it a legal obligation for public bodies to recognise the need to address and eliminate unlawful discrimination. In general, if someone discriminates against you due to your status as trans. You are almost always protected by law. This doesn’t mean you won’t face discrimination, it just means that you are protected against it by law and that if your education provider refuses to act upon the discrimination you can proceed with legal action against them.

* [USA] [San Francisco Unified School District’s policy regarding transgender and gender non-conforming students](http://www.healthiersf.org/LGBTQ/GetTheFacts/pol-transgender.html). This is a model policy that you can show to your school administrators as a guide for discussing what accommodations you will need as you come out. If your school or school board does not currently have any policy for how to treat transgender and gender non-conforming students, your coming out would be a great opportunity to establish such a policy.

## At Work

***
***How can I find a job while I'm transitioning?***

Finding employment can be difficult while you're transitioning, especially if your name and gender marker don't match on identification documents. You might be deliberating what name to put on your resumé and how to dress for job interviews. It is important to know your rights with regard to employment discrimination where you live (more on this later in this section). When applying for jobs, you may want to check whether the employer has established trans-friendly policies ([USA](http://www.masstpc.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Employers_with_Transgender_Friendly_Policies), [Canada](http://www.canadastop100.com/diversity/)). If you want to ask about an employer's policies, but don't want to out yourself as an applicant just yet, you can inquire anonymously by phone or email under a different name.

***How do I go about transitioning at my current workplace?***

You will work with your management and human resources (HR) department to plan and carry out your transition in the workplace. It is essential that they are on your side. You will develop a transition plan that spells out, in writing, the timeline of your transition (pointing out any milestones, such as dressing as male, hormones, and surgery). You will make detailed plans of what you expect from your boss, fellow employees, HR, and yourself throughout the process. You will offer resources (some are in this section of the FAQ) to help them understand and accommodate your transition. It is likely that your workplace has never had an employee transition before, so be aware that even if they are supportive, you are the one that must direct that support. A well-detailed work transition plan is key.

In some places, it is illegal to terminate an employee for coming out as trans; that said, it may be in your best interest to request a transfer to a different team or site. This can be a part of your discussion with your manager and/or HR. If you transfer after you begin presenting as male, it may be unnecessary for you to actually come out to your new coworkers. Discuss with HR about keeping your transition private from coworkers, on a need-to-know basis. 

If you do come out to your coworkers, you have several options: a team meeting, a mass email, and/or involving HR to help you come out. Remember that even though you are transitioning, your primary role in your workplace is to work. When putting together your transition plan, focus on being as non-disruptive as you can while still informing your coworkers enough so that they can support your transition.

When you come out at work, your coworkers will be curious and have questions, although they may not ask them to you directly. Think about whether you want to have a designated question-and-answer period, or deal with questions as they come. Providing resources may help reduce the questions you have to answer yourself. Your HR department may also help answer the questions of curious colleagues; if they do, you need to equip them with the specific information and resources you want to be used.

All this preparation can be a daunting task, but it is the preparation that is key to a successful coming out experience. We on /r/ftm would be glad to help you with ideas for your coming out at work.
