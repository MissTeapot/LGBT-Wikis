## What are the different types of top surgery available?

There are several different top surgery techniques available. Speak to individual surgeons about which of the techniques they perform, and what they recommend for you.

**Minimal Scar Surgery** is a possible option for those with smaller chests and excellent skin elasticity. It involves a small incision on the side of the chest and part way around the areola. See the diagram on [this page.](https://www.topsurgery.net/procedures/minimal-scar-top-surgery.htm)

**Keyhole surgery** is an option for those with very small breasts and small areola. The surgeon makes a small incision on part of the perimeter of the areola and uses liposuction to remove underlying tissue before closing the incision. See diagram on [this page.](https://www.topsurgery.net/procedures/keyhole-top-surgery.htm)

**Peri-areolar surgery** is an option for those with small breasts and good skin elasticity. Some surgeons will only operate if you're an A cup, some go up to B, and some say it depends on skin elasticity and ptosis (sagging). The surgeon makes a circular incision around the areola (or within it if the areola needs to be resized) and another incision in a concentric ring outside it. Breast tissue is excised by scalpel and removed through the gap between the two incisions. The incisions are sewn together with a “purse string” closure, attaching the larger circle of skin to the smaller circle around the nipple. See diagram on [this page.](https://www.topsurgery.net/procedures/peri-areolar-top-surgery.htm)

If your breasts are borderline small-large, then you need to decide whether to go for peri-areolar or double incision. Some people who are borderline are very happy with their peri results, but there are risks of ending up with loose skin or undesired nipple size/placement. The outcome depends on your size as well as your skin elasticity and healing. Here are some borderline peri results: [1,](http://ftmjasper.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/hello-world/) [2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eAEytiAIeo) 

**Double-incision surgery** is an option for everyone and may be the only realistic option for those with large breasts and/or with poor skin elasticity. The surgeon removes the breasts using incisions on each side, typically cut horizontally under the pectoralis muscle. Double-incision surgery most commonly involves **free nipple grafts** meaning that the nipples are resized and grafted back onto the chest once the incisions have been closed. See diagram on [this page.](https://www.topsurgery.net/procedures/double-incision-top-surgery.htm)

**There are several variations on double incision surgery.**

* **Inverted-T / T-Anchor surgery** is similar to what is used in breast reductions and uses a vertical incision from the nipple down to the larger incisions below the pectoralis muscle. It is similar to double incision except for the horizontal incision and the nipple stalk not being severed. Some surgeons prefer this technique because it gives them more control over the contour and makes it easier to position the nipple if it is retained rather than grafted. See diagram on [this page.](https://www.topsurgery.net/procedures/inverted-t-anchor-top-surgery.htm)

* **Buttonhole Technique** is similar to Inverted-t/T-Anchor but does not have the vertical incision line. The nipple stalk is left intact. See diagram on [this page.](https://www.topsurgery.net/procedures/buttonhole-technique-top-surgery.htm)

* **Pedicled nipple grafts:** Those who wish to retain nipple sensation may opt to have their nipples left attached via a stalk of tissue called a pedicle rather than having them removed and grafted on.
 
* **No nipple grafts:** Some simply opt out of the grafts without electing for the pedicle, so their chests do not have nipples at all. Some of these people may choose to have nipples and areolae  reconstructed via medical tattooing later on.

## How do I choose a surgeon for top surgery?

Here are some factors to consider when choosing a surgeon: 

* Location and travel time

* Techniques offered

* Cost of surgery, travel, hotel

* Need for revisions, and cost of revisions

Once you are considered a surgeon (or a few), contact them to arrange a consultation either in-person or by phone or email. In this consultation you can discuss everything listed above and these additional issues:

* Am I a good candidate for this top surgery technique?

* What will my recovery be like? How long will I stay in the area? How soon can I return to my activities?

* Do I need to stop taking any of my medications before the surgery?

* Do you have weight requirements?

* Do you require a therapist's letter or any kind of certification to clear me for the surgery?

* Will you accept my insurance plan?

* Do you have any photos results of the surgeries you've performed?

* Discuss your preferred placement of incision lines and nipple size/shape/location

## What is the recovery like for top surgery?

Top surgery is usually done on an out-patient basis, where you go home the same day. Some surgeons will keep you in the hospital overnight for monitoring. When you are discharged, your surgeon should provide detailed instructions for post-op care. If you don’t live nearby, you may have to stay in a nearby hotel for several days and see the surgeon for a final check-up before going home. Most surgeons will have you wear compression with a bandage or binder for several weeks post-op. The purpose of compression is to prevent blood from pooling in your chest. Most surgeons also insert drains, one on each side, to divert blood from the chest. Drains may be removed by your surgeon or by your family doctor. Some say that drains are the worst part of recovery. 

### Potential complications from top surgery:

* Nausea and fatigue from general anesthesia

* Hematoma or seroma: Buildup of fluid in the chest, which may resolve itself or be drained with a needle. 

* Loss of nipple/areola (can happen with grafts as well as with peri-areolar)

* Infection

* Scarring: [See Transguys.com Complete Guide to Scar Care](http://transguys.com/features/scar-care).

* Loss of sensation in chest and nipples, either temporary or permanent: See [/u/mightybite’s chest sensation map](http://imgur.com/a/fQdCT).

### How long after surgery do I need to rest before getting back to my activities?

The authors of this FAQ are not medical professionals and the following is not medical advice. See our full [Medical Disclaimer](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/ftm/index#wiki_medical_disclaimer.md).

The following is a rough guide to post-op recovery, assuming you don’t experience postoperative complications.  Always listen to your body and discuss your return to activity with your surgeon. 

|Activity |How long do I need to wait? |
|:-|:-|
| School or work | If you spend most of your day sitting, you ought to be able to return to school/work in about two weeks. If you do more standing and walking, you will need more time off. For any lifting or manual labor, expect to take at least a month off.| 
| Driving | You can feasibly drive once you are feeling well and have enough range of motion in your arms and chest. Make sure you’re able to operate the controls and turn around to look at your blind spots and rear. You must not be taking any narcotic pain medications when you drive.|
| Exercise or spots |Light exercise (e.g. jogging) can be resumed at 1 month post-op, provided you are feeling up to it and your surgeon approves. Be aware that all exercise, especially that which stretches or rotates your torso, can contribute to increased scarring. Activities that only move your lower body (e.g. stationary bike) are likely the lowest risk.   |
| Lifting | Lifting is especially risky because it uses the chest muscles that have just been dissected through during surgery and need to heal. Follow your surgeon’s advice on when to start lifting again, and start gradually. Don’t expect to be lifting as much as you did before surgery right off the bat.  |

## How can I lessen the appearance of my top surgery scars?
***

Scarring is highly variable from person to person. If you're bothered by the way your scars look, you have several options to reduce their appearance.

- Cortisone injections and laser scar removal are discussed on [Transguys.com](http://transguys.com/features/scar-care#injections) and a firsthand experience is found in [Neutrois Nonsense's blog](http://neutrois.me/2013/02/26/top-surgery-2-years-post-op/).

- Tattoo over and/or around the scars to distract from them. This can only be done on well-healed tattoos (at least 1 year old and have it okayed by your surgeon). You may wish to seek out a tattoo artist with a lot of experience covering scars, and have a consultation about what you have in mind and what is feasible.  Examples (NSFW): [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJOZ2oeF2V0), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ynKGiD0Ro)

- Medical tattooing uses ink to restore scars closer to your natural skin color. This procedure is usually done by a para-medical professional and is sometimes called scar repigmentation.

- Topical scar treatments (creams, oils, and strips) are discussed in-depth on [Transguys.com](http://transguys.com/features/scar-care).

- Scar revision surgery can be performed to remove scars that healed poorly, but there is no guarantee that the scars from this revision will turn out better.

## Can I get surgery if I'm a minor (under 18)?

Some surgeons will perform top surgery on minors. Each surgeon has their own requirements, so inquire with the surgeon you're considering. Some have a minimum age of 16, but others have operated on individuals as young as 12. Parental or guardian consent is always required.
