## How to Start

Any doctor with an M.D. degree is legally capable of prescribing testosterone to a patient. The issue is finding a doctor who’s familiar enough with transgender care and is willing to prescribe it to you. If you already have a general practitioner (family doctor), you have the option of asking them to supervise your hormone therapy. If they are not familiar with transgender care, and many doctors aren’t, they may be hesitant to supervise your care. You may be able to gain their support by providing them with some relevant medical resources (see below). 

Many people seek a different, trans-friendly doctor for hormone therapy rather than go their their existing family doctor. The easiest way to find a trans-friendly doctor is through referral from other trans people in your area. Local support groups, as well as online groups like /r/ftm, are good ways to meet people. Check out [T-Vox]http://t-vox.org/medical

[/u/tarazud gave some good advice on finding a provider in this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/2g7wqu/tips_on_researchingfinding_medical_and_mental/)

When you begin to see a doctor, be sure to ask what you can expect as a patient. Every doctor has their own process when it comes to therapy, physical examinations, bloodwork, billing insurance, and time between appointments. Ask, ask, ask. If all you want to know is when you can expect to get your prescription, then ask.

There are two general ways to get on testosterone: therapy and informed consent.

### Therapy route

It is a common practice for doctors to require a letter from a psychological professional before prescribing hormone therapy to a trans person. These letters generally contain a therapist, counselor, or psychologist’s certification that you have gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy is an appropriate step for your gender transition. Some therapists or counselors require that you see them for a specified amount of time (3 months, 6 months, etc.) before they will write this letter, while others will write it after a single appointment. Some require that you identify as a binary male, while others will recommend non-binary trans people for hormone therapy.  

### Informed consent 

*(doesn’t necessarily mean no therapy required)*

Some doctors are willing to prescribe hormone therapy to trans people on the basis of informed consent. The doctor will talk to you about the effects of testosterone, and you will sign a consent form indicating you understand the risks and consequences (hence the term, “informed consent”. With some (but not all) informed consent doctors, you can be prescribed T without providing evidence of therapy or a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. The option of informed consent is only available to those who are legally able to consent—those over the age of majority (usually 18 years) and without any psychiatric conditions for which you would be considered unable to give consent.

### Resources for health care providers

* [Medical Therapy and Health Maintenance for Transgender Men](https://lgbtqpn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medical-Therapy-and-HM-for-Transgender-Men_2005.pdf) by Dr. R. Nick Gorton

* [Primary Health Care for Trans Patients](https://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/TransHealthGuide/) by the Sherbourne Health Centre 

The above resources can be especially useful if you’re trying to get on testosterone with a doctor who’s not experienced with transgender care. They explain the informed consent model, how to monitor hormone therapy, and why it’s important to provide it for trans clients.

**A little tip:** If there's even a small chance you might be traveling internationally in the future, ask your doctor to write you a travel letter at the same time you get your testosterone prescription. See [Travel](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/ftm/index.md#wiki_travel)

***
### Hormone Therapy Under 18-years-old

Yes. Requirements vary between doctors and clinics, but almost always you will need parental or guardian consent to start testosterone. Often this is coupled with requirements for some time in therapy, additional evaluations, or a different minimum age (often 16). 

Depending on your age and your doctor’s protocol, you may be put on a hormone blockers like Lupron for some time before or concurrently with testosterone. If you are under 13-14 you will almost certainly be prescribed hormone blockers. Some clinics will not administer testosterone, but will administer blockers until you are 16, at which time you can start T.

Health care providers that provide hormones to trans teens:

* Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (New York City) 

* [Boston Children’s Hospital ](https://www.childrenshospital.org/centers-and-services/programs/f-_-n/gender-multispecialty-service/parent-and-family-resources)

* [CAMH Child, Youth, and Family Services](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/clinical-divisions/child-and-youth-psychiatry-division) (Toronto): Parent/guardian consent for hormones/blockers is not required after age 16. This clinic for children and adolescents is separate from the adult Gender Identity Clinic.

* [Sick Kids Transgender Youth Clinic (Toronto)](https://ontario.cmha.ca/documents/mental-health-services-for-gender-diverse-and-sexual-minority-youth/)

* Daniel H. Reirden, MD  Gender and Sexual Development Program, Children’s Hospital Colorado  13123 E. 16th Ave. Box 025, Aurora, CO 80045 P: 720-777-6131 (Denver)
* More providers for trans children and adolescents listed on [HRC's Interactive Map (North America)](https://www.hrc.org/resources/interactive-map-clinical-care-programs-for-gender-nonconforming-childr)

***
### Medical Reasons I might be refused testosterone

Before prescribing testosterone, your doctor will run some physical and lab tests, and talk to you about your situation. Here are some factors that could prevent you from starting testosterone right away.

* Doctor does not have enough experience or does not feel comfortable prescribing

* Doctor requires a therapist letter or other requirements

* Doctor will not treat people under the age of majority (usually 18 years)

* Presence of a medical contraindication such as pregnancy, certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease ([more](https://lgbtqpn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medical-Therapy-and-HM-for-Transgender-Men_2005.pdf), p. 16). Note that this resource lists real-life experience (RLE) as a requirement of the Standards of Care for starting testosterone, but it no longer is a requirement.

* Presence of uncontrolled mental illness or substance abuse

## Cost

This is highly dependent on your location and the specific medication you’re using. The following are very rough ballpark figures of *cost per month*, with the common dose of 100 mg/week for injections. For Canada, the [Sherbourne guidelines (p. 70)](https://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/product/4th-edition-sherbournes-guidelines-for-gender-affirming-primary-care-with-trans-and-non-binary-patients/) also contain a chart of approximate cost.

| | **Injectable** | **Gel** | **Patch** | **Notes** |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|:-----------|:------------|
| **Canada** | Delatestryl (testosterone enanthate): $30 CAD; Depo-testosterone (testosterone cypionate): $20 CAD | Androgel 1%: $225 (for a dose of 7.5 g/day of gel; $120/month for a dose of 5 g/day of gel |  $120/month for a dose of 5 g/day| | 
| **UK** | Under NHS, testosterone is paid for (minus prescription charges in England |Testogel and Testim: £40 | | If you are using private health care, your testosterone cost will depend on what product you use, whether or not you self-inject, and your clinic.  |
| **USA** | Testosterone cypionate: $10+ USD | Androgel and Testim: $160-210 USD |Androderm: $120-200 USD | [GoodRx](http://www.goodrx.com/) may have a coupon that will save you a significant amount. |
| | | | | NewEra Pharmacy, formerly called Strohecker's, currently, sells only [topical and oral testosterone.](https://newerapharmacy.com/compounding/compounded-products/)|
| | | | | Some insurance plans cover testosterone for trans men, regardless of the sex marker on file. Inquire about what your plan covers.|
| | | | | Your out-of-pocket cost could be anywhere from $0 to $100 USD. |

***I think my injection went wrong. Is it serious?***
First and foremost, if you feel you are in serious danger, go to the emergency room or contact your doctor. The authors of this FAQ are not medical professionals and the following is not medical advice. See our full [Medical Disclaimer](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/ftm/index.md#wiki_medical_disclaimer).

| **Issue**  | **Is is serious?** | **Anecdotal tips** |  
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Bleeding from injection site (more than a drop)** | If bleeding continues excessively and does not clot, seek medical attention.| If minor bleeding after injection is a recurring issue, try using a higher gauge needle, which is smaller in diameter. |
| **Bruising or muscle soreness** | Bruising and soreness should not last more than a few days. If it persists or is accompanied by a fever, see a doctor. | Try massaging the area to help relax before injecting. Soreness can be made worse if the muscle is tense while you inject. You can also try [different injection sites](https://www.bd.com/dc-anz/blog-index/the-importance-of-injection-site-rotation), under your doctor’s supervision, to find one that’s more comfortable for you. |
| **Coughing or shortness of breath** | This may be a sign that you accidentally injected some of the oil into a blood vessel. Testosterone injections are relatively low volume, so the coughing or shortness of breath usually lasts only a few minutes and there’s no need to seek medical attention. If it persists, go to your nearest emergency room. | Always aspirate before you inject: Insert the needle fully and pull out on the plunger. If you see red (blood) in the syringe, pull out and change the needle. If you don’t see red, proceed with the injection. |
| **Oil leaked out from injection site** | This is common and usually nothing to worry about. Don’t be too concerned over losing your dose. To get an idea, you can take a syringe (without needle) and fill it with cooking oil. Then eject some of it onto your leg until it looks like the amount that leaked from your shot. It’s probably a very small proportion of your entire shot. | To reduce leakage you might try using a longer needle to deposit the oil deeper in the muscle. Some people have had success by leaving the needle halfway inside for a minute or two after injecting. This allows the hole created by the needle to begin to close up. Also, ask your doctor about the [Z-track injection method](http://www.healthline.com/health/z-track-injection#Preparation3) which was specifically developed to reduce leakage.  |

***
***Am I injecting correctly?***

Never self-inject without proper training from a doctor or nurse. If you need a refresher, here are a few resources for intramuscular self-injection.

* [Taking Care of Business:  A DIY Guide to Self Injecting ‘T’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdlduQ4G20g) (video). This instructional video covers thigh and glute injections, and was produced in consultation with a registered nurse.

* [How To Give Yourself Intramuscular \(IM\) Injections](https://www.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/medication/5450.pdf) (pdf) by UW Health.

**I’m missing something for my injection!** You may find yourself in an injection situation that is not ideal. The optimal solution would be to not inject until you have everything you need. However, we know there can be financial barriers to accessing all these things. In real life, you may well be inclined to proceed with the injection anyway, so it would be wise to get to know the risks ahead of time. The following options should be considered a last resort. The authors of this FAQ are not doctors, and the following is not medical advice.

**I ran out of alcohol swabs!** The purpose of alcohol is to disinfect (kill bacteria) on every surface the needle contacts—the vial stopper and your skin. In practice, for an intramuscular injection, your chance of getting an infection is not significantly reduced by swabbing according to research (source). If you clean your hands and injection site skin with soap and water (which you should be doing before every injection anyway), it is relatively safe to inject without alcohol swabs.

**I only have one needle!** It is okay to use the same needle to draw the T from the vial and to inject it. Two separate needles are recommended because, 1) larger needles make for fast drawing and smaller ones make for less painful injecting, and 2) the needle dulls significantly after each use (image). But it’s not dangerous to use the same needle to draw and inject; it just might be more painful and/or time-consuming. 

However, reusing the same needle for two different injections is a very different story because the equipment is no longer sterile. In the time between the two injections, bacteria has had time to grow. To inject twice with the same needle carries a significant risk of infection.

**I loaded my syringe with T but didn’t end up injecting it!** So you couldn’t inject because you chickened out, or you were interrupted, or something else. Do not leave the T in the syringe; it will just sit there growing bacteria in it. If the needle has not yet entered your skin, you can inject the T back into the vial and use it later.

**My vial of T was exposed to extreme temperatures!** Check the packaging to see if your vial was exposed to temperatures outside of the specified holding temperature range. If you left the vial outside or in a car, then you can’t be sure how hot/cold it got, so you should assume that it was outside of the holding temperature range. If your T was exposed to cold, crystals may have formed in the vial. Let it warm up to room temperature and shake it to redissolve the crystals.

**My vial of T is expired!** When a drug is marked with an expiration date, it means that after that date has passed, the medication is no longer guaranteed to contain the correct substance in the correct dose. The active ingredient may have degraded, or decomposed into different and potentially dangerous chemicals, or maybe nothing has changed at all. But the integrity of the drug is no longer guaranteed by the manufacturer. If you use expired T, you do so at your own risk.

***
***I’m still getting my period after starting testosterone. Is something wrong?***

It is quite common to take several months, up to 6 months, for your period to stop. Be sure to raise this concern with your doctor. If you have previously been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), it can take longer than usual to stop. In any case, your doctor should be ordering bloodwork to check your hormone levels. Its possible that your dose is too low, or that something else is abnormal. 

***
***What happens if I stop taking testosterone?***

You may be thinking of stopping testosterone because you’ve had all the changes you want, you’re experiencing side effects to your health, or you’re considering detransition. For a summary of the changes that occur after stopping testosterone, see [here](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/ftm/index.md#wiki_detransition).

***
***How much genital growth can I expect to see on testosterone?***

This varies widely from person to person, and measurements are difficult to compare because there is no standard way of measuring. Anecdotally we hear that the bulk of growth happens in the first two years on T, with the fastest growth happening in the first few months. There is limited information regarding average length for trans men on testosterone. [Meyer et al., (1986)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3013122) surveyed a group of 30 guys and found an average maximum length of 4.6 cm (or 1.8 inches) which was reached after 1 year on T. The phallus was measured along its top (dorsal) side from the pubic bone to the tip. The greatest length in the group was 6 cm (or 2.3 inches). More recently, [Vukadinovic et al. (2014)](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/437378/) reported a range from 2.5 to 4 cm, with an average of 3.3 cm. This may not be representative of all trans men because the group consisted of 97 men who went on to have metoidioplasty, some of whom used DHT prior to the study.

***
***Isn't taking testosterone dangerous for your liver?***
The trans community is abound with rumors about the dangers of T, and many of them are outdated or inaccurate. The risk for each individual depends on the particular formulation of T, the dose, and pre-existing conditions. For a summary of current research on the effects of synthetic testosterone on liver function, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/3bo1hf/friendly_reminder_about_medical_talk/csnwmos).

## Summary of Changes from T


***What changes can I expect from testosterone, and when?***

The authors of this FAQ are not medical professionals and the following is not medical advice. See our full [Medical Disclaimer](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/ftm/index.md#wiki_medical_disclaimer).

Changes happen differently for everyone; what follows is a rough summary. Some of the information below comes from [Dr. Gorton’s guide](https://lgbtqpn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medical-Therapy-and-HM-for-Transgender-Men_2005.pdf), [Vancouver Coastal Health's Trans Care Guide](https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/gsc/assets/hormones_FTM.pdf) and the [Sherbourne Guidelines](https://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/product/4th-edition-sherbournes-guidelines-for-gender-affirming-primary-care-with-trans-and-non-binary-patients/), but for many changes, there is no reliable source on when they occur. This guide was put together by members of the /r/ftm community based on personal experience. 

Changes on testosterone are *gradual*, and you'll notice that many of them progress over the course of years. You may wish to keep a journal, photos, or videos to keep track of your changes. Have patience when it comes to developing the changes you want. However, one change you should look out is menstruation (monthly periods), which should stop after 6 months on testosterone. If it doesn’t stop by then, talk to your doctor. 

| **Change** | **When does it typically begin? / When does it typically reach its full extent?**|
|:--|:--|
|**Voice** | 1-8 months (Gorton, p. 59) / 1-2 years |
|**Body hair** | 3-6 months / 5+ years|
|**Facial hair** | 1-6 months / 8-10 years (Gorton, p. 49). Lots more info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/5bewsw/facial_hair_bearding_infodump/).|
|**Increased muscle mass** | Dependent on lifestyle and exercise (Gorton, p. 67)|
|**Cessation of menstruation (monthly periods)** | 0-5 months (Gorton. p. 51) / N/A|
|**Genital growth**| 1-3 months (VCH, p. 7) and sometimes within days or weeks / 2-5 years; some people report a second surge in growth after oophorectomy|
|**Texture of skin and hair**| 1-6 months / N/A|
|**Acne (face and body)** (Gorton, p. 50)| 1-4 months / 2-3 years |
|**Fat redistribution (face and body)**| 1-3 months (VCH, p. 7) / 2-5 years |
|**Increased sex drive**| Days to weeks (Gorton, p. 56) / N/A |
|**Hairline**| It is normal for the hairline to change from round to more square in the first months to years on testosterone. This does not mean your hairline will continue to recede as in balding. However, some people do experience male pattern baldness 1 year on testosterone (VCH, p. 7). Hair loss can be slowed or halted with drugs, but some drugs also inhibit facial hair growth (Gorton, p. 48).|
|**Emotional changes** (temporary or permanent)| Irritability or moodiness can occur in the days before an injection is due, especially when injections are taken quite far apart (e.g. every 2 weeks) (Gorton, p. 18). Speak to your doctor if you experience this. |
|**Changes to appetite and energy** (Gorton, p. 67-68)| |
|**Increased blood lipids and red blood cells (hematocrit)** (Gorton, p. 62)| |
|**Vaginal dryness and atrophy**| Occurs within months for some people. Sometimes it appears or increases after oophorectomy. |
|**Breast size**| Typically does not change significantly, but may due to fat loss or redistribution (Gorton, p. 55; SHC, p. 23) |
|**Height**| Typically does not change significantly, but may due to changes in cartilage and muscle mass, or if one’s long bones have not yet fused entirely. Fusion usually happens in teenage years (Gorton, p. 25, 30).|


[The Sherbourne guidelines (p. 67) also include a chart of expected time course of changes.](https://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/product/4th-edition-sherbournes-guidelines-for-gender-affirming-primary-care-with-trans-and-non-binary-patients/)

### Facial Hair

[Facial Hair &amp; Bearing Infodump](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/5bewsw/facial_hair_bearding_infodump/) by /u/poesii 

***
## Dose

### What is the right dose of testosterone?

Your dose of testosterone is something to be negotiated with your doctor, and tailored to your needs. There isn’t one “right” dose because every person processes testosterone differently. What matters is that your dose puts your testosterone blood levels within the normal male range. Doctors typically aim to put you in this range, and if your bloodwork shows you are above or below the range, your dose is adjusted accordingly.

In 2014, a survey on testosterone use was circulated through ftm communities on Reddit and Tumblr. The [results](http://imgur.com/a/oGwAE) indicate great variation in weekly doses being used, from 20 mg to 200 mg and beyond. This goes to show that the “right” dose is different for every person. 

Increasing your dose will *not* necessarily speed up the changes you experience. Excess testosterone in the body is converted to estrogen by the process of aromatization, so increasing your dose may actually add more estrogen to your system. If you feel your dose is too low for you, discuss with your doctor.

## Alternatives to Injection

### Are there any alternatives to injection?

Testosterone is available as gel, patch, and other forms. Speak to your doctor about what options are appropriate for you and available in your region.

| **Testosterone option** | **Description** | **Resources** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Gel/Cream**|Gel is applied daily to the skin. It is generally several times more expensive than injections. For people who are partnered with women or have children or mammalian pets, gel may be impractical due to the risk of skin-to-skin transfer. Doses on gel are often higher than with injections because only a small fraction of the testosterone in the gel gets absorbed into the skin.| Androgel (USA, Canada; [1](https://www.androgel.com/), [2](http://theartoftransliness.com/post/16696168957/androgel-q-and-a)), Axiron (USA; [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=axiron&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)), [Testim](http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-64793/testim-td/details) (USA, UK), [Testogel](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex-and-relationships/medicines/testogel.html) (UK), [Fortesta](http://www.drugs.com/fortesta.html)|

## Long-Term Safety 

There have been a few large-scale evaluations of the long-term health effects of testosterone therapy. 

- [Asscheman et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21266549) - Studying 365 trans men, over an average of 18.5 years receiving testosterone therapy, the researchers found that the patients did not develop any health conditions at a rate that was different from that of the general (non-trans) population.

- [Wierckx et al., 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230706285_Long-Term_Evaluation_of_Cross-Sex_Hormone_Treatment_in_Transsexual_Persons) - Studying 50 trans men over an average of 10 years receiving testosterone therapy, the researchers found that the patients did not see significant increase in health conditions such as hormone-related cancers, osteoporosis, or cardiovascular problems.

- [TranScienceProject - Hormone Therapy and Safety](http://transcience-project.org/hormones.html) synthesizes research on potential risks of type II diabetes, certain cancers, and polycythemia.

-[Weinand &amp; Safer, 2015](http://www.jctejournal.com/article/S2214-62371500049-6/fulltext) - A literature review of research on the safety of hormone therapy finds that it is safe under physician supervision, with the most common risk being polycythemia for trans men. There is no increase in cancer prevalence or mortality.

***
## Travel

***Can I travel (national or international) with my testosterone?***

When carrying your testosterone for travel, always keep it in the original vial and box, and carry the prescription. If you have a prescription for the needles and syringes, carry it too. Rules vary depending on the country or countries of travel, and the length of your trip. In some cases there is a maximum to the amount of medication you can bring. For an international trip, check the laws in both countries by contacting the appropriate embassy or browsing their website.

It is a good idea to carry with you a letter from your prescribing doctor that states that your testosterone is medically necessary, and that you also require the injection supplies. The letter need not say that you are trans. If travel is even remotely a possibility for you in the future, get your doctor to write this letter sooner rather than later!

## DHT

***What can DHT (dihydrotestosterone) do for me?***

DHT is a hormone that is related to testosterone and plays a role in the development of facial hair, body hair, male pattern baldness, and genital growth among other effects. A portion of the testosterone that you take is naturally converted into DHT. Pharmacy compounded DHT has been used by some trans men as a supplement to increase genital growth. This involves applying the medication to the phallus. Does it work? There are anecdotes of it working, and a small body of research showing it's effectiveness in cis men with micropenis ([article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8326617)), but there is no research on trans men.
