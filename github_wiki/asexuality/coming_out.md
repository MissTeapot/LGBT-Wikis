# Coming out

----------

## Why do asexuals come out?

There are, broadly speaking, three main reasons that asexuals feel like they need to come out.

First, contrary to what you might initially think, people really do care if you're asexual. Sex is a huge part of many societies and cultures, and it would naive to think that asexuals are somehow exempt from that social context just because they might not be interested in sex. For example, an in-the-closet asexual person might feel left out of a conversation with friends, or their family may say hurtful things without realising it. And of course, potential partners often need to know as well.

Second, it is inherently rewarding to be understood. When you're in the closet, there's a disconnect between your inner self, and the one you present to others. It can be cathartic to bring these different aspects of yourself into alignment. Being seen, and being able to express yourself are important for various factors of subjective well-being such as self-actualisation and agency. Just like any other aspect of life it's perfectly normal to want to share your experience with others.

Third, one of the primary problems facing asexuals in the modern world is that of invisibility. There are few things an asexual person can do that are more impactful in fighting this than being open about their sexuality. In fact, it's likely knowledge of asexuality, and especially that contact with out asexuals, has a reducing effect on anti-asexual bias [1]. This is in the same way that contact with homosexuals typically reduces anti-gay bias [1]. Many asexuals who discover asexuality from someone coming out, feel an obligation to do so themselves for the next person.

Asexuality isn't shameful, it's just a part of life. Of course people are going to talk about it.

##Should you come out as asexual?
Generally speaking if you're comfortable with doing so, yes. Disclosing your experience with others creates a deeper bond between you, frees you from guilt and stress, and can even help you to understand yourself. Letting a person know you're asexual takes it from an idea in your head out into the real world, better allowing you to come to terms with it and move on from there.

That said, you don't *need* to come out, and if you don't feel safe – or even if you just don't want to – then it's best not to. Though asexuals aren't often victims of hate, when people are ignorant they can say some hurtful and invalidating things. If you are reliant on the person you are coming out to (e.g. a parent), then it might be best to wait until you aren't. At the same time, often aphobia comes from a place of ignorance, and educating others can help a lot. Perhaps you could get them to read websites/articles such as this one.

Ultimately whether you want to come out or not is entirely up to you. Below you can find some quotes from asexuals that have come out, some of which are excerpts from the article [Asexuals on Coming Out: Experiences](https://www.asexualityarchive.com/asexuals-on-coming-out-experience/).

General:

&gt; When I came out, it was completely by accident. I was about 15. I was doing dishes with my Mom. Dad and my little brothers were in the living room right next to the kitchen. Somehow the topic of relationships came up and after they talked to each other about it they suddenly directed the conversation to me, I think they asked me what kind of girls I'm into or something. Without even thinking, I blurted out "Oh, I wouldn't know anything about that. I'm asexual". It was embarrassing.
&gt;
&gt; Luckily, I didn't get kicked out for not being straight or anything like you would usually hear. Most I dealt with was Dad and my little brothers making fun of me for two to three years for being asexual. Which I was already the butt of their jokes long before that so I was already used to shit like that.

Positive:

* &gt; The first time I came out, it was to a bunch of my long-time online friends, and I had a very positive response. After that, it was my parents, who were mostly okay with it, and then my more liberal friends, and now it’s pretty much any time it comes up. Most of the responses have been indifferent or positive

* &gt; Yes, my parents especially were accepting of me. They had never put any pressure on me before, so their reaction was mostly, “So that’s why. That’s cool.”

* &gt; I’ve been lucky. Everyone has been really great about it, once they knew what it was.

* &gt; All around it was a really great experience. I cried from happiness because it felt like a weight had lifted off my chest.

Negative:

* &gt; Most people disbelived me and even asked numerous questions to try and find the reason behing my unwillingness to fuck. A lot of them suggested therapy and treated me as a labrat that is now open to scrutiny and can be used to prove or refute their own personal theories.

* &gt; My cousin said some very hurtful things to me and I was very depressed, even suicidal for a while. I had to cut him out of my life. If people can’t accept you for who you are, then they don’t deserve your time of day.

* &gt; My mother was furious. I explained what asexuality was, but she was adamant it didn’t exist. “There’s only heterosexuality and homosexuality!” she shouted. I didn’t make matters better when I confessed to being bi-romantic. After threatening to hit me, she stormed out of my room. (I should note that she did not hit me, only threatened to.) Later when my dad came upstairs to wish me goodnight I came out to him too. He didn’t care so much about the bi-romantic part. But when I told him I was asexual- I’ve never seen him look so disappointed. He wasn’t angry, just sad almost. Like I’d failed him. He told me that I was still young, and not to make such a big decision just yet. Both my parents act like that night never happened.

Reasons for/against coming out:

* &gt; I came out to a small group of people (a mix of close family and friends) because I didn’t want to keep a part of myself I considered important completely to myself, and I think it’s important to be honest with those closest to you.

* &gt; I told other people because I couldn’t keep it to myself any longer. I felt like the longer I kept it a secret, the more ashamed of it I would become, and I didn’t want to be ashamed of my sexuality.

* &gt; I want young aces to know they’re not alone. I felt so isolated through much of my adolescence, and I think that if I had known of one other ace, I wouldn’t have felt as confused and alone as I did. So I want to be that one other ace for young people.

* &gt; My asexuality is not something I make a big deal out of, and I don’t really feel the need to tell people unless they specifically ask whether I’m ace.

* &gt; I only come out if it is necessary and would not voluntarily do so to anyone I didn’t know well, as I don’t see how my orientation is most people’s business.

##Explaining asexuality
Unlike many other orientations, asexuality is almost completely unheard of among the general public, which means you may more often find yourself having to explain your situation. The best way to explain to someone what your experience is is to tell them your story: lead them through the thought processes and revelations that made you realise that you were asexual. Telling your story invites others to empathise with you, which is how genuine connections form and strengthen.

If you're still struggling to explain, you may find an analogy helpful. For example, the analogies in [Sexual attraction](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/asexuality/index.md#wiki_sexual_attraction) explain sexual attraction in terms of things that everyone experiences. Another common analogy goes like this: imagine you're heterosexual, but you live on an island with only people of your own gender on it. How do you feel towards the other people on the island? Asexual people feel that way towards everyone, regardless of gender.

It's also very helpful to send people resources such as this wiki, other websites or video explanations such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i14YMpKS_CY&amp;feature=youtu.be) by Psych2Go. Getting an impartial voice to 'back you up' like this can make people take you more seriously and it demonstrates that asexuality isn't 'made up' or just a trend.

Above all else, be patient and ready to explain. Asexuality is a strange concept for most allosexuals, but if they know you well they will try to understand.

## Other tips
If you do decide to come out, you can read the advice below. They are summaries of some of the points made in the article [Asexuals on Coming Out: Advice](https://www.asexualityarchive.com/asexuals-on-coming-out-advice/).

* Tell the people you trust most first. Start with your close friends/siblings before older family members. You can practise and work your way up to the more difficult/important people.
* Tell people one at a time if possible.
* Consider taking a friend (who already knows) with you.
* Have a support system ready if something goes badly, e.g. a friend you can vent to.
* If things go badly then be patient. Often people will slowly come around if you're persistent enough.
* Send emails or letters if face-to-face seems too daunting. This will give you an opportunity to explain everything without interruption, and give links to resources where questions can be answered correctly. Communicating via text gives you as much time to respond as you need.
* Choose a time when the other person isn't stressed, angry or otherwise in a bad mood.
* Educate yourself and get your thoughts in order, it will make you more convincing. It never hurts to quote statistics such as that 1% of people are asexual.
* Consider and articulate whether your coming out is accompanied by changing expectations for your relationship to the other person. For example, if you are coming out to a romantic partner, tell them what effect the revelation will have on whether sex is on the table, if so how often relative to previously, or what kind of sex, etc.
* If someone says you're broken, or a freak, or something like that, don't believe them. Be proud of who you are. Don’t let anyone tell you who you are, who you should be, or that it's just a phase. No one knows more about your experience than you do.
* If you don't make a big fuss about it, others may not either.
* Never come out as an expression of guilt.
* People are often understanding. If they know you well, they’re probably at least somewhat aware of the fact that you’re asexual; they just may not have a name for it.
* Talk about the asexuality of other people to see how they respond.
* Be prepared for possibly intrusive questions. Most importantly, remember that you don't have to answer anything if you don't want to. Your boundaries are still valid even when you're coming out.
* Think of a good analogy/metaphor for how you feel.
* Give people resources such as this wiki and other sites/videos/etc.
* Coming out doesn't have to be one conversation: numerous hints over time can culminate in an eventual coming out.
* The a-spectrum is a confusing and novel concept for most people. Usually it's best to first introduce only the broad concepts (e.g. a lack of attraction), and save more complicated aspects (e.g. aegosexuality) for future conversations. Give people time to process what you're telling them.
* Ask yourself why you want to come out, and consider articulating that to the other person.
