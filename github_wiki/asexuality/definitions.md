# Definitions of terms

[*Back to wiki main page.*](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/asexuality/index.md)

----------

While it may seem silly that there are so many 'made up' words surrounding things like asexuality, their usefulness cannot be understated. Words exist so that people have the language to talk constructively about issues that are important to them – and sexuality does have a significant impact on many people's lives. Countless posts in this subreddit alone demonstrate that people can feel much less lonely when they find a term and community to help them understand what they were feeling.

Terms like those below also create the conditions for greater awareness, and contrary to what it might seem, they do not need to be used to divide people into separate camps. Sadly, it's always possible to use words in a harmful way, and these terms may play a role in enabling othering behaviour to occur more easily. However, in such a case, it is always the perpetrator at fault rather than the words themselves.

* **abrosexual**: *adj.,n.* Refers to a person whose sexual orientation is very fluid or changes frequently. The sexual orientations can be any: for example, one abrosexual may fluctuate between heterosexual and homosexual; another might fluctuate between asexual, bisexual, and homosexual. See also *aceflux*.

* **abroromantic**: *adj.,n.* Refers to a person whose romantic orientation is very fluid or changes frequently. The romantic orientations can be any: for example, one abroromantic may fluctuate between heteroromantic and homoromanticl; another might fluctuate between aromantic, biromanticl, and homoromantic. See also *aroflux*.

* **ace**: *n.* A shortened term for asexual. May also refer to the a-spectrum more generally.

* **aceflux**: *adj.* Refers to a person whose position on the asexuality–allosexuality spectrum tends to change over time. A form of abrosexuality where as least one of the orientations fluctuated between is asexuality or grey-asexuality.

* **acemisia**: *n.* An alternative term for acephobia.

* **acemisic**: *adj.* Of or relating to acemisia.

* **acephobia** (also called **ace-phobia**): *n.* Hatred or discrimination directed towards asexual people on account of their orientation. Acephobia is a prejudicial attitude toward asexual people based on negative stereotypes. It can include believing that asexual people:
    * are less than human or against human nature,
    * are deficient or broken; that it is a result of mental illness or sexual abuse,
    * have just not met the "right" person,
    * are confused or 'going through a phase',
    * cannot experience love and have relationships,
    * are just "prudes"; that asexuality is a choice rather than an orientation,
    * don’t face oppression and are damaging the LGBT cause.

* **acephobic** (also called **ace-phobic**): *adj.* Of or relating to ace-phobia.

* **acespike**: *adj.* Refers to a person that doesn't experience sexual attraction the majority of the time, but occasionally has periods of feeling very strong attraction.

* **aegosexuality** (also called **autochorissexuality** or **anegosexuality**): *n.* A subset of asexuality defined as a disconnection between oneself and a sexual target/object of arousal. See [*Grey asexuality: Aegosexuality*](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/asexuality/grey-asexuality.md#wiki_aegosexuality).

* **aesthetic attraction**: *n.* An urge to observe, be close to, be sensual with, or have a relationship with a specific person based on their physical appearance. Usually the term implies a lack of sexual or romantic attraction to that person. See [*The a-spectra: Sensual and aesthetic attraction*](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/asexuality/the_spectra.md#wiki_sensual_and_aesthetic_attraction).

However, the term in its current usage is nowadays relatively entrenched, in part due to the fact that it is less clunky and/or misleading than common alternatives such as 'sexual' or 'non-asexual', but also because the allo- prefix allows for the simple construction of new terms (e.g. 'allonormativity'). 'Zedsexual' is a commonly proposed term with the same meaning.

* **allonormativity**: *n.* Refers to the assumption that everyone is or should be allosexual, and/or the ways that society overlooks or delegitimises the experiences of asexuals. This is also a synonym for amatonormativity.

* **amatonormativity**: *n.* Refers to the assumption that everyone does or should experience romantic attraction, and/or the ways that society overlooks or delegitimises the experiences of aromantic people.
