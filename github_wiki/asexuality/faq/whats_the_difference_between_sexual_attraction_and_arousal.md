# What's the difference between sexual attraction and arousal?

[*Back to FAQ index.*](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/asexuality/faq.md)

---

Arousal refers to bodily changes or urges themselves, whereas sexual attraction refers to when such urges are targeted at a specific individual. Typically arousal and sexual attraction are strongly related, with each one able to induce the other to occur. However, a significant proportion of asexuals report experiencing sexual arousal with no 'attraction' component.
