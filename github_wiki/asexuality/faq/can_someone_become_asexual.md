# Can someone become asexual? / can sexuality change?

Yes and no. Sexuality can be fluid, and people can shift between different sexualities over time. That said, changes in orientation, when they occur, happen by themselves with no element of choice involved. If someone tells you their sexuality has changed, it's best to believe what they say.
