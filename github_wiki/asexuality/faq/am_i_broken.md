# Am I broken?

No. Asexuality is a normal, healthy orientation just like heterosexuality, homosexuality, etc., and your experience is valid. Many asexuals go through a period of feeling like they are broken, but in reality it is our culture that is broken. A society that responds so dismissively and apathetically to you being authentically yourself is clearly not functioning properly.
