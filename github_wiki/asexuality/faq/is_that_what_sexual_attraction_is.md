Sexual health professionals also make the distinction between sex drive and sexual attraction:

&gt; Dr. Michael Yates, clinical psychologist specialising in sexual health, said: "Sexual attraction is a motivation to engage in sexual activities with another person. It is possible to still have a sexual drive, but for that not to be directed at another person."

Allosexuals generally describe sexual attraction as being a distinct *feeling* that is about being drawn to have sex with a specific person. As explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/ag01h3/allosexuals_what_does_sexual_attraction_feel_like/), allosexuals often describe a feeling of wanting to 'get as close as possible to / touch' the other person, which asexuals don't. Asexuals generally conceptualise sex to essentially be masturbation but with another person, which is in contrast to the explanations given in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/am4tm6/having_sex_vs_masturbating/).
