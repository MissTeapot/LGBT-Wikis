# Can I be asexual if I consume pornography / erotica?

---

Asexuality is a lack of a desire to have sex with specific other people. While the consumption of pornography may involve such an desire, it doesn't have to. Asexuals may consume pornography for a number of reasons, including the following.

* They might see it as an intellectual curiosity, or just use it to pass the time with no arousal involved.
* They may be [aegosexual](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/asexuality/grey-asexuality#wiki_aegosexuality.md), meaning that they can be aroused by pornography but do not have an accompanying desire to participate in sex or the subject of the pornography.
* They may be [grey-asexual](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/asexuality/grey-asexuality#wiki_generalised_grey-asexuality.md), meaning that they can experience sexual attraction, but only rarely.
