Due to its general invisibility is popular discourse, it's not uncommon for an asexual person to only discover their orientation when already in a long-term romantic relationship with an allosexual. A common hurdle in this situation can be each partner trying to convince the other that they are still loved in the same way they were before the revelation.

While there is no obligation on either partner to continue such a relationship, if both are willing then here's some advice on working through this kind of situation.

## As the asexual partner

Your partner may be struggling with one of the following false beliefs.

* That a romantic love can only exist if sex (or at least the desire for sex) is involved.
* That a person cannot have or enjoy sex without being attracted.
* That it's easy to know your orientation, especially after trying sex.
* That the newly discovered / revealed asexuality is in fact new, rather than something that has always been there.

## As the allosexual partner

Your partner may be struggling with one of the following false beliefs.

* That it's selfish to ask an allosexual not to have (or to have less) sex in a relationship.
* That an allosexual who chooses not to have sex is secretly suffering and will want to break up eventually.
