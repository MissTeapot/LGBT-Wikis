# Asexual symbols

[*Back to wiki main page.*](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/asexuality/index.md)

-----
Like other sexual minority communities, asexuals have a number of symbols. Symbols demonstrate unity, pride, shared values, and allegiance to one another, as well as communicate ideas, concepts, and identity both within our community and to mainstream culture. Giving people something to associate themselves with provides normality to what is an overall socially-isolating situation.

### Flags and colours

#### Asexuality

![](%%asexual%%)

The asexuality flag is the most widely recognised symbol for asexuality (which you can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Asexual_flag.svg)). The flag consists of four horizontal stripes: from top to bottom they are black, grey, white, and purple. The black stripe represents asexuality, the grey stripe represents grey-sexuality, the white stripe represents sexuality, and the purple stripe represents the a-spectrum community.

The flag in its current design was announced in 2010.

Other a-spectrum flags include the following.

#### Aromanticism

![](%%aromantic%%)

#### Demisexuality &amp; demiromanticism

![](%%demisexual%%)  ![](%%demiromantic%%)

#### Grey-sexuality &amp; grey-romanticism

![](%%grey-sexual%%)  ![](%%grey-romantic%%)

### Ring
A black ring worn on the middle finger of the right hand is a common symbol of the asexual community. The material and exact design of the ring are not important as long as it is primarily black.

Rings like this provide asexuals with a discreet visual clue that the people around them may also be asexual. They can also be an inoffensive way of psychologically 'trying out' an asexual identity to see if it fits. Similar to coming out, wearing a ring can help an idea become more real over time and eventually lead to comfort, self-acceptance, and a feeling of being connected to others.

The symbol of a black ring originated from a [2005 AVEN thread](https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/76607-black-rings-and-other-ways-to-show-asexual-pride/), being a subversion of the traditional wedding band that demonstrated a rejection traditional relationship values. However, even at the time this was recognised as not an appropriate message to represent asexuality as a whole, and in the broader community the ring has never carried any such connotation.

### Cake
Cake is used as a symbol for asexuality by allusion to the common observation that asexuals prefer cake to sex. Although some asexuals may enjoy sex more than cake, the observation highlights how many asexuals see sex as something ordinary, like eating a cake.

### The ace of spades
Based on a pun on the word 'ace', the ace of spades, or more generally the spade symbol found on playing cards, is used as a symbol for asexuality. Spades is used because it is recognisable, and because it is by far the most likely to come to mind when thinking of an ace in a set of playing cards. 

# Lists of asexual people

Below we have included a few lists of asexuals. These lists are by no means exhaustive, and are intended rather to give an idea of some of the representation of asexuality that exists in the world.

### Famous people

The following is a list of famous known or suspected asexual people. The list is is limited to either those that have explicitly confirmed that they are asexual or who are very likely to be asexual.

* David Jay (founder of AVEN and asexuality activist) – confirmed
* George Norman (the UK's first openly asexual parliamentary election candidate) – confirmed
* Tim Gunn (fashion designer) – confirmed
* Janeane Garofalo (comedian) – confirmed
* Paula Poundstone (comedian) – confirmed

* Edward Gorey (children's author) – confirmed
* Keri Hulme (author) – confirmed
* Valeriya Novodvorskaya (Russian politician) – suspected
* Kim Deal (musician) – confirmed

### Historical figures

Since asexuality has only emerged recently as a term, for historical figures we can only make educated guesses. The list below is quite conservative, limited only to those that are rather likely to have been asexual.

* Fréderic Chopin (composer) – based on his correspondence with Amandine-Aurore-Lucile Dupin
* Salvador Dali (surrealist) – described both by himself and his contemporaries as 'asexual', 'anti-sexual' and 'lacking any interest in anything sexual'
* Isaac Newton (physicist and mathematician) – never married or showed any interest in anything sexual. Unlike most unmarried men of the renaissance, there is no evidence to suggest that he was gay
* J. M. Barrie (author of Peter Pan) – although he married, it was reportedly unconsummated, and the couple had no children. He was described by his family as *never experiencing what one might call 'a stirring in the undergrowth' for anyone – man, woman, or child*.

### Fictional characters

The following is a list of known or suspected asexual characters in fiction. Asexuality is rarely confirmed by creators which can make it hard know for certain.

* Sherlock Holmes – likely (a victim of asexual erasure in later media)
* Gilligan (Gilligan's island) – likely
* Jughead Jones (Archie comics) – confirmed in the work itself (a victim of asexual erasure in later media)
* Todd Chavez (Bojack Horseman) – confirmed in the work itself
* Georgia Warr (Loveless) – confirmed in the work itself
* Liv Flaherty (Emmerdale) – suspected 
* Raphael Santiago (Shadowhunters) – confirmed in the work itself
* Monkey D. Luffy (One Piece) – confirmed by the author
* Adrian Monk (Monk) – suspected (it's implied that he and his wife had a loving, committed relationship that did not involve sex)
