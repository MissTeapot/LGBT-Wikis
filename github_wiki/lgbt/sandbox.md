This is where I will be working on the FAQ. I'm ditching the 'to-do list' method of working on new pages and just organizing the whole thing from top to bottom. If there is a blank section it is for all intents and purposes 'to be done' or something. Please don't refer to this page if the FAQ is not yet completed; once everything is sorted out I will move this whole document to [the actual FAQ page](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/lgbt/faq.md), so let that be an indicator of completion. If you have any suggestions or criticisms about this page as it stands, feel free to message me (/u/MANBOT_).
  
A slight note: while it only looks like one section out of several, and even less so because I haven't set up any subsections, actual Frequently Asked Questions section will be the dominating aspect of this document, as it should be.

**Right now**: I'm starting everything up, adding subsections to all of the pages as I'm going along! The 'definitions' section looks like a bulleted list, but I'll be elaborating on each 'bullet' so it isn't going to be so...wishy-washy. I don't expect anyone to read this page but adding a 'this is what I am doing right now' section might help me keep track of things if I take breaks for a week or something.
