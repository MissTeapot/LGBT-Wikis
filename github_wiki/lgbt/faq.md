Stuff to Avoid
----

#### Attraction/annoyance

*"It's just that I'm not attracted to...” or “I just find ______ people extremely annoying."*

Everyone has their preferences and nobody has the right to tell you who to be attracted to or not find annoying, however it is undeniable that part of being a member of a minority group inevitably comes with having to deal with people making excuses for their prejudices using their attractions and preferences as justifications. In LGBT contexts, it generally manifests as prejudice against femme gay men, butch gay women, trans people, and people of color. It gets old and fast. In an LGBT safe space, we should be able to feel comfortable in our queerness without having to hear about how being butch, femme, having a trans body, or otherwise something other than hetero, white, or cis-normative is annoying or unattractive to you. Please keep it to yourself.

#### Jokes/reclamation

*“It's just a joke” and “reclaim the word, then and stop being such a doormat!”*

Whether it's possible to reclaim a word has more to do with its history and usage than whether some people on reddit decide to not to get offended when somebody makes a hurtful or triggering joke, and reclaimation certainly doesn't happen through getting angry that would-be reclaimers are told to knock it off. Appreciate that not everyone's experience of common anti-LGBT words, phrases, and slurs are going to be the same. Some people will say it doesn't hurt them and others will have heard it only in very hurtful contexts. Because r/lgbt is highly public and a safe space, we ask that you treat others with respect and not expect that they should push through the tears and laugh so that you can make whatever joke you want. You might also want to consider that the "joke" you want to make almost assuredly isn't that funny, and that you could do better if you applied yourself. Hurtful jokes and pejoratives at the expense of sexual orientations and gender identities are likely to be removed. Ultimately, berating somebody won't make them change their mind and decide you're funny, so we suggest dropping it and writing or repeating a good joke instead. 

#### Erasure


*“You're not ______, you're just _________”*

Telling someone that their identity isn't what they declared but something else entirely is known as erasure. In LGBT contexts, it's usually seen in reference to bisexuals, pansexuals, intersex, asexual, and transgender people. In a LGBT safe space, we will not presume to tell other people what they are. We will assume, unless they identify as “questioning,” that they know what they are. After all, we don't live inside their heads, they do, and thus are infinitely more familiar with the floor plan. Shrugging off gender identities and non-heterosexual orientations is historically a very common method of marginalizing LGBT people. We come to r/lgbt to get away from it, so wipe your feet at the door.

#### Pronoun Use

Being misgendered for those who are transgender can be deeply offensive as it is an assault against that person's gender identity. Due to this using correct pronouns is important especially with respect to transgender members of this subreddit. Please be mindful of the pronouns people prefer and if you are unsure, use the singular "they" form. It is generally acceptable to ask specifically what pronouns people prefer.

Intentionally misgendering people, especially those who are openly transgender, is grounds for swift and immediate moderator action.

#### Fantasies/fetishization

*“I just love yummy ______ who _________, post pix!” “You people are the best of both worlds!”*

Be mindful when you're sharing your sexual fantasies. Everyone has 'em, except maybe asexuals, and we all know how frustrating it can be even to reference them in the most PG fashion when there are nothing but straight cis people around. Because it can seem uniquely challenging for LGBT people to discuss these things outside of queer spaces, sometimes we let our hair down here and r/lgbt discussion can take a turn for the naughty. It is important, however, when you're sharing or discussing these things to be mindful of the fact that some of the groups under the LGBT umbrella are commonly oversexualized and fetishized, and that being a member of one of these groups can be exhausting. Be careful not to dehumanize other posters in r/lgbt. We are people, not just sex objects. Lesbians do not make out so that straight or bi men can watch. Bisexual men and women do not exist for your threesome fantasies. Some may do that sometimes but others may have no interest whatsoever. Trans and intersex people do not exist to have a “little something for everyone.”

#### Speak for yourself

*“South Park said that fags are people who ride Harleys, dont get offended, you see Stephen Fry once said,”*

Speak for yourself. Some people's parents throw them coming out parties and set them up with their gay friends' gay kids or take them out clothes shopping the minute they get their hormones. The rest of us have less than welcoming circumstances. In r/lgbt discussion, we must all be mindful that some of us are called “faggots” and “trannies” by genuinely hateful and sometimes threatening people and that we come to get away from that. If you're in a situation where nobody hates you and nobody is a threat to you because of your gender identity or sexual orientation, then you are in a better situation than some of the people who come to r/lgbt. Not everyone has circumstances where they are safe or accepted and not everyone who says “lol you're a faggot” is just a harmless dork trying (and honestly, likely failing) to be funny. 

#### Concern trolling

Concern trolling. Concern trolling is when somebody either professes to be in favor “I'm an ally!” or even “I'm L/G/B/T/Q/I/A myself” but then wishes to express some concern or other they have “but pride parades are gross.” Concern trolls can be so insidious and so harmful that sometimes they may even have you questioning whether you really have the right to expect equal treatment. They may be doing it on purpose or out of genuine ignorance, but the consequences are the same either way. Mods are on the lookout for concern trolls. Old and tired common concern trolls include:

* Pride parades showing flamboyant people hurt the cause!
* Trans women have penises and therefore are threats to cis women.
* Telling people not to call you a slur is going to lose allies.
* You can't expect everyone not to be homophobic/transphobic/biphobic.  Getting upset about it every time hurts the cause.

Concern trolls are not to be confused with actual allies, whose support we appreciate and enjoy. Please remember what the grown-ups told you about how to know whether your friend is really a friend. A good ally will not tell you that you should accept whatever people call you, or that you should act less queer, or that you are a threat to anyone because of what you are. A good ally will support your right to be yourself.

#### Harm reduction vs. False dichotomy

Depending on where you live, acceptance of GRSM people can be more or less difficult to find. For those of us who feel that we are in an area or a situation where allies can be difficult to find, it can be necessary or tempting to accept whatever we can get. How do you know the difference?

Say you had to choose between two candidates for supreme ruler of your nation. One of the candidates, Ms. Murder, supports the death penalty for GRSM people. The other candidate, Ms. Whippings, supports whippings for GRSM people. Neither is a great idea, but if you abstain, you might end up with the death penalty candidate. Let’s face it: you have to vote for Ms. Whippings. That’s harm reduction. Harm reduction is complacency. It is the act of accepting that something bad is going to happen and choosing the lesser of two evils. A real world example includes Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, the former improvement on No Gays Ever (not its official title) that kept gays out of the military.

Now Ms. Whippings has won. You and all the other GRSM people successfully reduced harm and now you’re all alive and well, though regularly whipped. Maybe you even kind of like being whipped. Maybe you were going to get whipped on a regular basis anyway. Some people are dying because of the whippings, but some kind of look forward to it. Ms. Whippings’ supporters have now split in two, the pro-whipping faction, and the anti-whipping faction. The anti-whipping faction is bloodied and bruised and would like the whippings to stop. The pro-whipping faction is having a great time and would prefer the anti-whipping faction just shut up because, hey, at least Ms. Whippings isn’t Ms. Murder. What the pro-whipping faction has created is an example of a false dichotomy. A false dichotomy is the perception of a choice between two things and only two things to the exclusion of all outside options.  **It is the deliberate refusal to acknowledge other feasible options** (such as no whippings at all) **to the purpose of furthering one's own agenda.**

While argumental fallacies are not strictly forbidden in r/lgbt, they tend to run rampant and are often (consciously or unconsciously) concern trolls. Common examples include but are not limited to:

* Don’t boycott Chick-fil-A. Sure, they contribute hundreds of thousands to anti-gay organizations, but at least they HIRE gay people!
* Stop ragging on the HRC. Sure they throw trans people under the bus at every opportunity they get, but they’re all gay people have got!
* Sure, the Salvation Army calls us abominations and will only erect shelters where they are allowed to discriminate in employment, but they help homeless people.
* Sure, these allies call us fags and fairies and whatnot, but we need them if we’re going to get anywhere. You catch more flies with honey!

Abusive people and organizations count on your continued compliance with these false dichotomies. Nobody is forcing their hand to discriminate, even a little bit, but the public false perception of these situations as harm reduction actually perpetuates harm. In r/lgbt, there are several discussions about people and organizations that engage in this sort of rhetoric to justify their continued “softer” discrimination. If you’re not one of the people that the organization in question is discriminating against, it might be tempting to ask why you must give up this rare ally, this person, organization, or principle that has done so much for you. It’s understandable, but you must try to consider the plight of the person who doesn't so much like these whippings. Failure to do so will be treated the same as concern trolling because it is the same as concern trolling. Comments will removed and their authors possibly banned.

After all, if the CEO of Chick-fil-A came in to r/lgbt asking how many GRSM people he had to hire before he could ethically contribute to Ms. Murder’s campaign, we wouldn't let him get away with that, but that’s what’s happening. Don’t let the timing fool you.

#### Tone Policing

You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. Tone policing is an attempt to silence those people within the community who are angry, hurt, or emotional. It is often espoused by concern trolls or as a derailing tactic, in order to make the discussion about ''how you've said something'' instead of ''what you've said.'' 

When someone says something oppressive — that can be a racist slur, an ableist stereotype, a misogynist dismissal, an invalidation of identity/experiences, being asked invasive and entitled questions, and so on – it feels like being slapped in the face, to the person on the receiving end. The automatic response is emotion and pain. It’s quite exhausting and difficult to restrain the resulting anger. And, frankly, it’s cruel and ridiculous to expect a person to be calm and polite in response to an act of oppression. '''Marginalized people often do not have the luxury of emotionally distancing themselves from discussions on their rights and experiences. [Source](http://rosesmusings.tumblr.com/post/8610765878/this-is-a-post-about-tone-policing Rose's Musings)

Some more commonly seen tone policing statements include:

* It's just a joke
* Lighten up
* This isn't worth your time
* Why are you getting up in arms about this?
* You are tilting at windmills
* We need those allies, don't berate them
* Maybe the best thing to do is to be ''kind''
* Maybe the best thing to do is to be ''patient''
* You catch more flies with honey than vinegar
* You're being too sensitive
* You're too emotional

#### Silencing

*"You talk about being ________ too much" "Stop cramming your lifestyle down my throat!"*

Straight, cis people enjoy the liberty to discuss their partners, gendered fashion statements, weddings, dates, and encounters at social gatherings as much as they like, but because it is so common, it tends to blend in to the background noise and people don't notice that these people are broadcasting their heterosexuality and cis gender identities.  Therefore, when trans people discuss gendered decisions they make including fashion or social groups (skirts, girlscouts, boyscouts), and when bi/pan/homosexual people discuss their choices of partners, whether that be in the context of who they've been with for years or who they were flirting with at which bar on Friday night, it tends to stick out like a sore thumb.  In non-lgbt spaces, some of us catch a lot of heat for speaking about these things and "cramming them down people's throats" and as a result, people generally have a lot of pent up desire to discuss those things in r/lgbt.  Because this is an LGBT discussion forum, absolutely no amount of discussing a person's gender or orientation should be considered "too much."  They are on-topic, no more, no less.  Further to the point, when somebody comes in and discusses a problem they had or are having IRL because of their gender or orientation, accusing them of just being too obviously queer or talking about their queerness too much will be considered harmful language and subject to deletion.

#### On Sexism

Gender politics on reddit get ugly, and fast.  r/lgbt is usually a pretty good place for gender politics, as women usually don't find themselves asked to post pictures of themselves naked or overly criticized or objectified.  However, there is sometimes sexism and it's important to note that this can get very close to home.  [Misogyny and trans/bi/homophobia are inextricably linked.](http://www.aclu-sc.org/the-roots-of-homophobia/)  A great deal of homophobia can be attributed to people's discomfort with seeing men "act like women" in the form of being attracted to men, acting feminine, or being on the receiving end of sex, and with women rejecting men or having any sexual desires at all.  As such, many readers of r/lgbt will be well-versed in gender politics.  We ask that you take particular care to avoid the common types of misogyny that hurt LGBT people, most commonly "It's just that I find femme gay guys annoying," "lesbians are just afraid of men/man-haters" "bisexual (women) are just sluts," etc.  We also ask that you avoid common misogynist lies propagated by mens' rights organizations as outlined in this helpful page by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2012/spring/myths-of-the-manosphere-lying-about-women).  That being said, we understand that many of the people in r/lgbt are teenagers and/or otherwise well-meaning and not everyone has taken gender studies classes.  Anything that is not outlined here in the FAQ will remain undeleted as long as the posters participate in the conversation with respect and a willingness to learn.

#### Mod Sass

Moderating a large subreddit with the flimsy tools provided by reddit is a large time sink, often arduous, and more often than not thankless. The mods' only motivation for doing it is to have one tiny corner of the larger reddit subreddits actually be a decent, safe place for GRSM people to go and not be subject to the same homophobic, transphobic, sexist, and racist nonsense that they encounter in their day to day life and the rest of reddit. Despite the delusions many people have of reddit moderators being magical wizards wielding unlimited magical internet power, the reality is closer to that of the online equivalent of the kinds of janitors people call because they really don't want to clean shit off of the bathroom ceiling for the third time this week and can't someone else just do it this time? As such, if you post talking about how the mods are literally hitlerstalin polpot and omg they're all so horrible and terrible for enforcing the rules of their subreddit that are clearly outlined, do not be surprised if more swift and severe action is taken on you. Also, you can expect a similar amount of respect received in return if you attempt to contest moderator action, especially if it includes additional sass.

Moreover, responses to moderator action along the lines of "BUT I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SAFE SPACE" are highly suspect and quite frankly, the moderators are tired of hearing it. Safe space does not mean you have the right to post whatever inane drivel comes to mind without regards for how it might make others feel, in fact it means the opposite, no matter how much proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation you used to make a problematic post. These statements show that you clearly have not read the rules, and do not understand them. As such, do not be surprised if severe and swift action is taken to remove your posting privileges in response.

#### Serophobia

Serophobia is the manifestation of fear or aversion directed towards people living with HIV. Similarly, misleading or false information about HIV and AIDS is a bannable offense, as is advocating the continuation of discrimination against gay men donating blood.

#### Paraphilia vs Sexual Identity

*"Aren't pedophiles sexual minorities too?" "I know what it's like to be oppressed for being gay/trans, I'm a furry/otherkin!"*

&gt;A paraphilia is a condition in which a person's sexual arousal and gratification depend on fantasizing about and engaging in sexual behavior that is atypical and extreme. A paraphilia can revolve around a particular object (children, animals, underwear) or around a particular act (inflicting pain, exposing oneself). Most paraphilias are far more common in men than in women. The focus of a paraphilia is usually very specific and unchanging. 

&gt; [--Psychology Today, "Paraphilia"](http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/paraphilias)

Please understand that there is a long and sordid history of GRSM rights movements being undermined and hijacked by pro-pedophile organizations such as NAMBLA and status-quo defending mouthpieces, often deliberately, confusing sexual identity and pedophilia, bestiality, and other paraphilias with GRSM identities in order to try to lump us as "bad" or "other". It's a huge and current problem; for instance that there is mountains of evidence and lived experience speaking to people who are trans using restrooms the same way cis people do, it's unfortunately common for anti-rights hate groups to gain traction in proposing anti-trans bathroom laws by conjuring up images of pedophile trans women preying on children in the bathroom. Similarly, we've also heard the slippery slope rhetoric asking "what's next, zoophilia being legal?" when GRSM rights are on the table, despite that consenting adults engaging in sexual relations have nothing to do with having sex with animals. 

To put a finer point on a particular important case, /r/lgbt will not host any sophomoric or ignorant "debate" about whether or not pedophilia and homosexuality are "linked" or "basically the same" (spoiler: they're not) as it is an abject form of homophobia and transphobia and has no place in an LGBT Safe Space.

For other paraphilias that take place between two (or more) consenting human adults, understand that rights movements for people who participate in those paraphilias is fundamentally different than rights movement centered around sexual or gender identity. Trying to do so does a disservice to both GRSM people and the GRSM movement, as well as people who share your paraphilia and any activism regarding it. While this is a large subject that could be explored at length, on our end the short version is that homophobia and transphobia aren't exactly over and our limited resources for fighting for our immediate needs must be spent on just that. Attempting to ride on the coattails of the GRSM rights movement and spend the social capital that we've fought hard for in order to advocate for a paraphilia is incredibly disrespectful, and as the fight for GRSM rights isn't over, won't even work well at all in advancing whatever rights a particular paraphilia advocacy campaign seeks.

By way of example of what not to do, you will not win favor here if you, say, post your design for an otherkin flag that's just the transgender flag with some modifications, or demand that polyamory be included with GRSM marriage legislation on the grounds that it's "basically the same struggle."

#### Spam
We will remove spam of both submission and comment spam, and ban the user doing so, this includes spam of comments that just consist of /r/thathappened and /r/cringe  or the assosciated "And they all clapped" "and that man? Albert einstein". memes. If you dislike a post, speak about it for sure, just don't try and turn the comment section into a circlejerk about how you don't believe it, you have your own subreddit for that.

## Did you break the rules? 
---

**Tips for a successful appeal to restore posting privileges**

#### Acknowledge/Understand

Demonstrate an understanding of why your post was hurtful.

#### An Action Plan

We want to know that you don't intend to do it again and that we can safely return you to the conversation without having to remove you.  Demonstrate this.

#### Respect

The moderators do not ban for "just" disagreeing with you, they ban for violating the rules and more importantly, for making the environment hostile to GRSM people. The mods have a growing and impressive collection of very funny modmails where this is fundamentally misunderstood. If you have failed to read this document and/or make any attempts to understand it, expect to get responses to appeals of moderator action that contain as much effort as you put in to understanding what this subreddit is for.


**You can message the mods [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) to discuss your ban.**

#### Terms
This section is still WIP!  Please message the mods [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) with any terms that should be added. 

#### A

agender

adj. : a person with no (or very little) connection to the traditional system of gender, no personal alignment with the concepts of either man or woman, and/or someone who sees themselves as existing without gender. Sometimes called gender neutrois, gender neutral, or genderless.

ally

/“al-lie”/ – noun : a (typically straight and/or cisgender) person who supports and respects members of the LGBTQ community. We consider people to be active allies who take action on in support and respect.

aromantic

/”ay-ro-man-tic”/ – adj. : experiencing little or no romantic attraction to others and/or has a lack of interest in romantic relationships/behavior. Aromanticism exists on a continuum from people who experience no romantic attraction or have any desire for romantic activities, to those who experience low levels, or romantic attraction only under specific conditions. Many of these different places on the continuum have their own identity labels (see demiromantic). Sometimes abbreviated to “aro” (pronounced like “arrow”).

asexual

adj. : experiencing little or no sexual attraction to others and/or a lack of interest in sexual relationships/behavior. Asexuality exists on a continuum from people who experience no sexual attraction or have any desire for sex, to those who experience low levels, or sexual attraction only under specific conditions. Many of these different places on the continuum have their own identity labels (see demisexual). Sometimes abbreviated to “ace.”

#### B

bicurious

adj. : a curiosity toward experiencing attraction to people of the same gender/sex (similar to questioning).

bigender

adj. : a person who fluctuates between traditionally “woman” and “man” gender-based behavior and identities, identifying with two genders (or sometimes identifying with either man or woman, as well as a third, different gender).

bisexual

#### C

cisgender

/“siss-jendur”/ – adj. : a gender description for when someone’s sex assigned at birth and gender identity correspond in the expected way (e.g., someone who was assigned male at birth, and identifies as a man). A simple way to think about it is if a person is not transgender, they are cisgender. The word cisgender can also be shortened to “cis.”

cisnormativity

noun : the assumption, in individuals and in institutions, that everyone is cisgender, and that cisgender identities are superior to trans* identities and people. Leads to invisibility of non-cisgender identities.

cissexism

noun : behavior that grants preferential treatment to cisgender people, reinforces the idea that being cisgender is somehow better or more “right” than being transgender, and/or makes other genders invisible.

closeted

adj. : an individual who is not open to themselves or others about their (queer) sexuality or gender identity. This may be by choice and/or for other reasons such as fear for one’s safety, peer or family rejection, or disapproval and/or loss of housing, job, etc. Also known as being “in the closet.” When someone chooses to break this silence they “come out” of the closet. (see coming out)

coming out

1 noun : the process by which one accepts and/or comes to identify one’s own sexuality or gender identity (to “come out” to oneself). 2 verb : the process by which one shares one’s sexuality or gender identity with others.

gender binary

noun : the idea that there are only two genders and that every person is one of those two.

gender expression

noun : the external display of one’s gender, through a combination of clothing, grooming, demeanor, social behavior, and other factors, generally made sense of on scales of masculinity and femininity. Also referred to as “gender presentation.”

gender identity

noun : the internal perception of an one’s gender, and how they label themselves, based on how much they align or don’t align with what they understand their options for gender to be. Often conflated with biological sex, or sex assigned at birth.

gender non-conforming

1 adj. : a gender descriptor that indicates a non-traditional gender expression or identity (e.g., "masculine woman"). 2 adj. : a gender identity label that indicates a person who identifies outside of the gender binary. Often abbreviated as “GNC.”

genderfluid / gender fluid

1 adj. : a gender identity label often used by people whose sense of self in relation to gender changes from time-to-time. The time frame might be over the course of many months, days, shorter, or longer, but the consistent experience is one of change. 2 adj. : a general descriptor for an individual's or society's ever-changing (i.e., "fluid") embodiment of gender, in the ways it affects us or we express it individually (e.g., someone might express gender fluidly), and/or in how it is socially constructed.

#### H

heteronormativity

noun : the assumption, in individuals and/or in institutions, that everyone is heterosexual and that heterosexuality is superior to all other sexualities. Leads to invisibility and stigmatizing of other sexualities: when learning a woman is married, asking her what her husband’s name is. Heteronormativity also leads us to assume that only masculine men and feminine women are straight.

heterosexism

noun : behavior that grants preferential treatment to heterosexual people, reinforces the idea that heterosexuality is somehow better or more “right” than queerness, and/or makes other sexualities invisible.

heterosexual / straight

adj. : experiencing attraction solely (or primarily) to some members of a different gender.

homophobia

noun : an umbrella term for a range of negative attitudes (e.g., fear, anger, intolerance, resentment, erasure, or discomfort) that one may have toward LGBTQ people.

homosexual

adj. &amp; noun : a person primarily emotionally, physically, and/or sexually attracted to members of the same sex/gender.

#### I

intersex

adj. : term for a combination of chromosomes, gonads, hormones, internal sex organs, and genitals that differs from the two expected patterns of male or female. Formerly known as hermaphrodite (or hermaphroditic), but these terms are now outdated and derogatory.

passing

1 adj. &amp; verb : trans* people being accepted as, or able to “pass for,” a member of their self-identified gender identity (regardless of sex assigned at birth) without being identified as trans*. 2 adj. : an LGB/queer individual who is believed to be or perceived as straight.

polyamory / polyamorous

noun : refers to the practice of, desire for, or orientation toward having ethical, honest, and consensual non-monogamous relationships (i.e. relationships that may include multiple partners). Often shortened to “poly.”

#### Q
queer

1 adj. : an umbrella term to describe individuals who don’t identify as straight and/or cisgender. 2 noun : a slur used to refer to someone who isn’t straight and/or cisgender. Due to its historical use as a derogatory term, and how it is still used as a slur many communities, it is not embraced or used by all LGBTQ people. The term “queer” can often be use interchangeably with LGBTQ (e.g., “queer people” instead of “LGBTQ people”).

questioning

verb, adj. : an individual who or time when someone is unsure about or exploring their own sexual orientation or gender identity.

#### T

third gender

noun : for a person who does not identify with either man or woman, but identifies with another gender. This gender category is used by societies that recognise three or more genders, both contemporary and historic, and is also a conceptual term meaning different things to different people who use it, as a way to move beyond the gender binary.

transgender

1 adj. : a gender description for someone who has transitioned (or is transitioning) from living as one gender to another. 2 adj. : an umbrella term for anyone whose sex assigned at birth and gender identity do not correspond in the expected way (e.g., someone who was assigned male at birth, but does not identify as a man).

transition / transitioning

noun, verb : referring to the process of a transgender person changing aspects of themself (e.g., their appearance, name, pronouns, or making physical changes to their body) to be more congruent with the gender they know themself to be (as opposed to the gender they lived as pre-transitioning).

transman; transwoman

noun : a man/woman who was not assigned that gender via sex at birth, and transitioned (socially, medically, and/or legally) from that assignment to their gender identity, signified by the second part of the term (i.e., -man, -woman). Also referred to as men and women (though some/many trans people prefer to keep the prefix “trans-” in their identity label).

transphobia

noun : the fear of, discrimination against, or hatred of trans* people, the trans* community, or gender ambiguity. Transphobia can be seen within the queer community, as well as in general society. Transphobic – adj. : a word used to describe an individual who harbors some elements of this range of negative attitudes, thoughts, intents, towards trans* people.

transsexual

noun &amp; adj. a person who identifies psychologically as a gender/sex other than the one to which they were assigned at birth. Transsexuals often wish to transform their bodies hormonally and surgically to match their inner sense of gender/sex.

transvestite

noun : a person who dresses as the binary opposite gender expression (“cross-dresses”) for any one of many reasons, including relaxation, fun, and sexual gratification (often called a “cross-dresser,” and should not be confused with transsexual).

two-spirit

noun : is an umbrella term traditionally within Native American communities to recognize individuals who possess qualities or fulfill roles of both feminine and masculine genders.
