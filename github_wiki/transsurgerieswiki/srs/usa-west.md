I've been legally transitioned for 19 years and have had this plan for surgery in place since then. I see no reason to require a year's worth of therapy for this one requirement.

For example, a traditional Penile Inversion Vaginoplasty includes bilateral Orchiectomy, Penectomy with preservation of glans and shaft skin, and penile inversion often with a secondary scrotal graft. For non-binary individuals, Dr. Wittenberg can perform nullification with stand-alone Orchiectomy and/or Penectomy. Dr. Wittenberg can also preserve the penis, if desired, and perform Orchiectomy and Vaginoplasty using scrotal and groin or abdominal skin.*

There's a new interview with Marci Bowers by anti-trans author of the book [Irreversible Damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_Damage) where she speaks out against puberty blockers for trans children. This article immedialty appeared in the usual hate groups and media. Bowers has also discussed the article (and didn't disagree with what it said) on [her Twitter account](https://twitter.com/marcibdoc/status/1445285681572589573).

I spoke with my OBGYN who handles my HRT and has worked with quite a few trans patients ... she told me that Im not the first Bowers patient who was ghosted which was somewhat unsettling... it's an absolute disregard of what I told her going into surgery. I clearly stated to her that I wanted aesthetics over depth, and then she sacrificed my aesthetics to try to make depth. She stretched everything too tight and caused me to need multiple revisions to fix it, because she refused to listen to what I told her at our consultation."*

They were always kinda hedging when they said this, so I never got a clear "you're definitely fine" but they didn't seem concerned about it at all. Unfortunately, I just hit 4 months out and it seems that I have a LOT of hair growth. It's really upsetting and the options for dealing with it seem really limited, so I'm not sure what to do now...  I would guess probably 2+inches, it's pretty deep, so IDK if there's really going to be anything I can do about it."*

In his 2016 paper [Men’s health and transgender surgery: a urologist’s perspective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837315/) a significiant part seems to be about *Managing patient expectations*, and in particular genital dimensions (managing expectations is generally a euphemism for preparing for disappoinment) - *"For transgender women without a history of circumcision, the gold standard technique is penile skin inversion (where the shaft skin itself is inverted and passed, with the shaft base intact, into the neo-vaginal space). This alone generally yields sufficient skin for satisfactory neovaginal depth (minimum 4 inches)."*

I don't know if this is the same doctor, however I'm not aware of any other SRS surgeons by this name and the Plaintiff's counsel is "Jess Ting, M.D." who is a well known SRS surgeon.

The procedure went normally and healed well. Everything else is intact, I never ended up having GCS. I was grateful to never have to feel testicular pain ever again, but I was wrong! A couple of weeks ago I did yoga for the first time in years and ended up thinking I pulled a muscle in my groin area... I was admitted to the hospital the following day, skipping me ahead of a bunch of people because of the whimpering and clawing at my seat in the lobby... The searing agony came back in just a time for them to put me on heavy medication and kept me overnight. Once they had the MRI they found that one of my spermatic cords had gotten tangled in the inguinal canal and seemingly pinched with an artery. It then got swollen and stuck there... They said they'd perform surgery if it comes back. If I did have surgery, the surgeon would have made an incision in the pelvic region a couple inches above the swelling and snipped the spermatic cord higher up so it could never tangle again. So... if you're thinking about getting an orchi it couldn't hurt to ask your surgeon to snip a little higher, right? lol"*

* reply to [Opinions on Shane Morrison?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/114nqhh/opinions_on_shane_morrison/j8xjmy3/) by  tranifestations in 2023 - *"My closest friend just had phalloplasty with him and I was their advocate and caregiver. Surgically things went… fine… But their team is a MESS, there was zero training for nursing staff on how to work with trans people, they were forced to share a room in the hospital with total strangers, the aftercare was non existent and every medical professional we interacted with had a totally different opinion on how best to care for their body... Morrison, on the other hand, is very ego driven, in my opinion. At face value he seems caring, his CV regarding trans care is incredible. But in practice he did a lot of shady moves regarding my friends care. And further, he was not accountable to the position he put my friend in and was very dismissive of our concerns. It’s also incredibly hard to reach him after surgery and see him at post ops. My friend actually had zero post ops scheduled and we had to demand that they be scheduled weekly and for them to see Morrison himself. Morrison had a lot of excuses about why he could not be seen but we insisted that for something like trans lower surgery, it is unprecedented for the surgeon to not be available for post ops in the first month."*
