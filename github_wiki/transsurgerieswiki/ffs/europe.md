2pass also do electrolysis and there's some information on that in the SRS Introduction page.

From the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_van_de_Ven) on Bart van de Ven  (Simon and Capitan are Facial Team in Spain) - *In 2008 he founded the Agave Clinic in Marbella, Spain, where he worked with Dr Daniel Simon and Dr Luis Capitan... He moved to Ghent in May 2010 where he continued to grow his FFS practice. In April 2015 he took over an aesthetic medical centre in Antwerp called the Piccard clinic, together with Dr. Ellen Defrancq. They renamed it into the o2 clinic. Owing this 1100m2 building enabled them to start 2pass Clinic...*

From Susans.org - [Dr Bart buys new 5-star clinic](https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php?topic=185801.0) in April 2, 2015 - *"My wife Ellen and I are proud to announce that we now have our own clinic. It is Piccard Clinic where we worked until it's bankruptcy in november 2014. Starting Monday the 6th of April my consultations and surgeries will take place at Ringlaan 51 in Berchem."*

Prior to the surgery, he stated that he had done it before and was pretty confident; he really put me at ease actually... After the surgery, my nurse informed me he would not be doing any post-surgery examination with me and they were a bit puzzled as to where he was. A couple days passed and I noticed I still had a very prominent bump under my dressings, but I was informed that swelling was to be expected so I ignored this. I was rushed to out of hours who informed me what had happened was Mr Halsnad had stitched the muscle to the outer tissue when closing the two incisions and the muscle pulling down (when yawning) had torn the inner incision open again. I developed a haematoma and was advised to see Mr Halsnad again for treatment. Despite numerous attempts to see him, he was never available - including the appointment he agreed to make for me, I was made to consult his colleague instead who tried to convince me my Adam's apple was just part of the swelling... I eventually got an appointment with Mr Halsnad where he admitted he had not performed a tracheal shave, he had just tried to shave some of the Adam's apple but did not know how to remove it due to inexperience. He was unable to provide any evidence he had performed the procedure before. It is now three years later, I still have my Adam's apple (exactly the same size and prominence as before) in the addition to scar tissue... Please avoid this surgeon if you can."*
