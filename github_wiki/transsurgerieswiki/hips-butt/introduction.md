# Brazilian Butt Lift

This 2018 article in New Beauty is a good introduction to the recently realised dangers of the Brazilian Butt Life. The death rate is around 1 in 3000, vastly higher than other aesthetic surgeries. Surgeons are adopting new techniques in an attempt to reduce the risk.

 * [Why One of the Hottest Plastic Surgery Procedures Is Also the Deadliest](https://www.newbeauty.com/blog/dailybeauty/12376-brazilian-butt-lift-bbl-risks-danger/) 
 
Similarly in the Huffington Post

* [Brazilian Butt Lifts Are Resulting In An Alarmingly High Mortality Rate](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/brazilian-butt-lift-risks_us_5b6c39c1e4b0530743c77cf6) in 2018

The source of all the concern are these papers.

## New Safety Procedures

New procedures have been intriduced to improved safety iwith BBL, however it is not clear how many surgeons are following them, and its still a relativly dangerous surgery.

This YouTube video [Safe BBL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJlnXtq3FMo) by Aslani in late 2018 talks why BBL has been dangerous and a new technique to make it safe. He refers to [Dr. Daniel del Vecchio](https://cirumed.es/english/dr-daniel-del-vecchio/) who invented the EVL lipofilling technique. See the paper [Expansion Vibration Lipofilling — EVL — A New Technique in Large Volume Fat Transplantation](https://dev-journals2013.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/publishahead/Expansion_Vibration_Lipofilling___EVL___A_New.98180.aspx) by Del Vecchio and Wall in 2018.

The EVL paper reports on 2419 BBL procedures over 5 years, with no cases of fat embolism, although there were other complications. Its not clear to me how this proves anything given that the previoulsy estimated death rate was in 1 in 3000.

In a repsonse to another paper [Commentary on: Experience With High-Volume Buttock Fat Transfer: A Report of 137 Cases.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535328) by Teitelbaum in September 2018, *"The statements “High-volume buttock transfer is safe” and “High-volume fat transfer can be performed without significant complications as demonstrated in this case series” are audacious statements to make based on the outcomes of 137 patients."*. He also discusses safety techniques and some other reports. Teitelbaum was involved in the 2017 investigation by the Aesthetic Surgery Education and Research Foundation.

https://www.prweb.com/releases/liposuction_safest/buttock_augmentation/prweb13784354.htm - refers to EVL and references a paper and https://www.safelipo.com/

In 2020 surgeons Del Vecchio, Daniel A.and Rohrich, Rod propose to rename the procedure in the paper [A Changing Paradigm: The Brazilian Butt Lift Is Neither Brazilian Nor a Lift—Why It Needs To Be Called Safe Subcutaneous Buttock Augmentation](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Fulltext/2020/01000/A_Changing_Paradigm__The_Brazilian_Butt_Lift_Is.58.aspx).

In 2020 [Improvement in Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) Safety With the Current Recommendations from ASERF, ASAPS, and ISAPS](https://academic.oup.com/asj/article/40/8/864/5822125) a paper published in Aesthetic Surgery Journal by  Luis Rios, Jr and Varun Gupta found *"In 2017, the ASERF Gluteal Fat Grafting Task Force reported gluteal fat grafting to be a high-risk procedure and recommended specific surgical techniques to decrease the risk of pulmonary fat embolism (PFE)... In the 2 years following the publication of the recommendations, the incidence of any PFE was 1 in 2492 compared with 1 in 1030 reported in 2017 (P = 0.02).* ***Trends indicated a decreased mortality rate from 1 in 3448 in 2017 to 1 in 14,952 in 2019.*** *Ninety-four percent of respondents were aware of the recommendations.* ***Only 0.8% of surgeons*** *in the current survey reported injecting in deep muscle, compared with 13.1% in 2017 (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with 4.1% in 2017, 29.8% of respondents in our survey reported that they only injected with cannulas ≥4.1 mm (P &lt; 0.01).* ***Only 4%*** *of respondents reported angling the cannula down in the current survey, compared with 27.2% in 2017 (P &lt; 0.01)."*

In 2020 [Assessing Cosmetic Surgery Safety: The Evolving Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7572219/) by Rod J. Rohrich, Ira L. Savetsky, and Yash J. Avashia - *"In* ***May 2019, a new survey*** *was sent to members of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. The survey asked about fat embolisms and deaths associated with gluteal fat grafting in the past 24 months (the time since safety recommendations were established, including the strong recommendation that all BBLs are done using only subcutaneous fat augmentation only) (Luis Rios Jr, MD, personal communication). This survey showed a* ***mortality rate of 1:14,921,*** *which means it is now statistically safer than an abdominoplasty."*

In Florida (USA) the high death rate remains even in 2022 (and the reason why is of concern for *any* surgical procedures in Florida).

* 2022 - [Brazilian Butt Lift-Associated Mortality: The South Florida Experience](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35959568/) by Pat Pazmiño, Onelio Garcia - *" South Florida has experienced 25 BBL related fat emboli deaths from 2010-2022, however 14 of those deaths have taken place after the Aesthetic Surgery Education and Research Foundation (ASERF) guidelines and the Florida Board of Medicine BBL "subcutaneous-only" rule.* ***The working environment at the clinics and the short surgical times for these cases, may be the most important contributors to the BBL mortality in South Florida.*** *"*

A realself article by Miamai surgeons explains how the death rate for BBL has improved, while not mentioning that it this improved safety does not apply in Florida

&gt; The survey, published in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal in 2020, found the BBL mortality rate has dropped to 1 in 14,952, “which puts the BBL at a better safety profile than tummy tucks, which have a mortality rate of 1 in 13,147,” says Miami board-certified plastic surgeon Dr. Onelio Garcia

&gt; * April 25, 2022 - [Is Getting a BBL Dangerous? New Risk-Reducing Guidelines Aim to Help the Brazilian Butt Lift Reform Its Reputation](https://www.realself.com/news/brazilian-butt-lift-surgery-less-dangerous) by Jolene Edgar, Medical review by Dr. Luis M. Rios Jr.

On 15 June 2022 a Board of Medicine Emergency Rule was issued by the Florida Department of State on the standard of care for BBL surgery in Florida due to the continued high rate of deaths from BBL in the state.

I don't know if he does any trans surgery, but his YouTube channel is "interesting". He does lots of body sculpting, fat transfer, etc, and patients tend to be very slim by Western standards.

It looks like he works in Medan in Indonesia, so probably not safe to visit if you're trans. Its probably more of interest to show what can be done with low body fat.

This YouTube video [Safe BBL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJlnXtq3FMo) by Aslani in 2018 talks why BBL has been dangerous and a new technique to make it safe. He refers to [Dr. Daniel del Vecchio](https://cirumed.es/english/dr-daniel-del-vecchio/) who invented the EVL lipofilling technique. See the paper [Expansion Vibration Lipofilling — EVL — A New Technique in Large Volume Fat Transplantation](https://dev-journals2013.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/publishahead/Expansion_Vibration_Lipofilling___EVL___A_New.98180.aspx) by Del Vecchio and Wall in 2018.

Cirumed have an annual live surgery conference. While its probably not open to the non-professionsals, its very interesting they hold it - and that other surgeons attend.

* Cirumed [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo86emrqMOE) announcing the 7th annual live surgery course in 2019.
* https://livesurgery.cirumed.es/course.html - *"This year 2019 the event is totally focused on live surgery, designed to have a highly practice orientated, practical teaching experience. It is our objective to provide surgical inspiration, valuable take-home messages and overall a boost to the practices of all our guests."*
* https://livesurgery.cirumed.es/doctors.html *"This course will count with the presence of internationally renowned plastic surgeons, who will treat, among others, a topic so important nowadays as safety in the fat transfer to the buttocks. They will also demonstrate the techniques they use for Composite Breast Augmentation (Supercharged Breast Augmentation) and Composite Buttock Augmentation (Supercharged Brazilian Butt Lift)."*
* https://www.moeller-medical.com/blog/6th-live-surgery-course-marbella/ - *"The 6th Live Surgery Course, organized by Dr. Alexander A. Aslani, took place in Marbella, Spain (May 24-25, 2018).* ***Around 130 doctors*** *were provided surgical inspiration and teaching experience by internationally renowned plastic surgeons. Live broadcasts from the operating theatre of the Cirumed Clinic in Marbella showed participants the skills of surgeons from three different continents. The cumulative experience of thousands of aesthetic operations by the speakers and lecturers made the event a practical highlight."*

Dr Aslani has an entry on the GMC site, [Alexander ASLANI GMC reference no: 6156042](https://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/6156042). In the history tab it says "This doctor has undertakings".

 An [undertaking](https://www.gmc-uk.org/concerns/information-for-doctors-under-investigation/our-sanctions/undertakings) is a sanction  against a doctor *"We can take action to make sure we protect patients, maintain confidence in the medical profession and uphold the standards we expect of doctors. We can give doctors a warning. Or we can agree undertakings with them in certain cases."*
 
* https://www.gmc-uk.org/concerns/information-for-doctors-under-investigation/our-sanctions
 
On the undertakings page it says *"When are undertakings appropriate? We will only offer undertakings to a doctor when we decide they are enough to protect patients and the public, and address the concerns about the doctor."*

## Florida

Many doctors in Florida do not carry malpractice insurance. See the [wiki introduction](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/transsurgerieswiki/srs/introduction.md#wiki_florida) to see what this means.

Also note the high death rate in Florida from BBL even after new safety guidelines were introduced, *"South Florida carries the highest BBL mortality by far in the nation... South Florida has experienced 25 BBL related fat emboli deaths from 2010-2022, however 14 of those deaths have taken place after the Aesthetic Surgery Education and Research Foundation (ASERF) guidelines and the Florida Board of Medicine BBL "subcutaneous-only" rule. The working environment at the clinics and the short surgical times for these cases, may be the most important contributors to the BBL mortality in South Florida."*
