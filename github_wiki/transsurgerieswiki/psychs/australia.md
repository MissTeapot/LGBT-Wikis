Some of these psychs and therapists listed on this page are members of [AusPath](https://auspath.org/providers/) and listed on their site - however that doesn't mean they are well regarded in the trans community. If a provider is not a member of AusPath it doesn't mean much - the well known Sydney endocrinologist Dr Jonathan Hayes was never a member of AusPath (or AnzPath that preceded it). Where possible find a psych who is well regarded in the trans community. There are people in Australia who you should avoid.

https://auspath.org.au/providers - lists providers in Australia, but it doesn't say if they are good or not.

# Warning

You should be very careful when choosing a therapist or psychiatrist, read reviews and look for red flags. There's a number of people who should be avoided, and they are not all listed here.

In October 2021 the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) came out with a postion statement supporting [coversion therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy). It's apalling that such a thing can still happen in Australia and a very bad sign of things to come.

There's a good analyis of this in the Facebook Group International Transgender Health

* [The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) comes out supporting compulsory conversion therapy (CT) for trans children, adolescents and adults in Position Statement 103](https://www.facebook.com/groups/transgenderhealth/posts/4794589253918796/) by Lisa Toinen Mullin on 14 October 2021

The Position Statment itself.

* [Position statement 103: Recognising and addressing the mental health needs of people experiencing Gender Dysphoria / Gender Incongruence ](https://www.ranzcp.org/news-policy/policy-and-advocacy/position-statements/gender-dysphoria)


A response in 2022 this postion statement, [Re: The RANZCP position statement on gender dysphoria](https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221112007) by Sav Zwickl, Belinda Chaplin, Fiona Bisshop, Teddy Cook, Clara Tuck Meng Soo, Belinda Birtles, Jaimie Veale, Rona Carroll, Rachel Johnson, Joey Macdonald, Jesse Porter, Cassie Withey-Rila, Zoe Kristensen, Ashleigh Lin. [PDF HERE](https://auspath.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zwickl-et-al.2022-Re-the-RANZCP-position-statement-on-gender-dysphoria.pdf). I reconise some of these these people as leading Australian researchers, doctors, etc specialising in transgender care. Sav Zwickl is a notable researcher, Dr Fiona Bisshop is a GP in Brisbane and president of AusPATH, Teddy Cook is on the board of AusPATH, responsible for transhub, and organising medical the Sydney medical community's to care for 4000 trans people after Dr Jon Hayes retired in 2019, Clara Tuck Meng Soo is a well respected trans GP in the ACT awarded the [Order Of Australia in 2016](https://hercanberra.com.au/uncategorized/transgender-gp-dr-clara-tuck-meng-soo-hands-back-her-australian-honour/). Its well worth reading the entire resoponse, but I've extracted some bits here

&gt; Historically, psychiatry has played a central role in the pathologisation of those seeking medical gender affirmation. Gatekeeping, the process by which gender affirming care has been withheld or controlled by the medical field, has been widely practiced in psychiatry, neglecting a patient-led, informed consent approach. As we outline below, the recent RANZCP position statement frames the trans experience as inherently pathological. This is in direct conflict with World Health Organization, American Psychiatric Association, World Professional Association for Transgender Health, AusPATH and PATHA, all of whom make it clear that being trans is not a pathology. Through selectively citing research and treatment guidelines, the position statement equates peer-reviewed evidence with ‘professional opinion’ and the notion of supporting trans people as a ‘debate’.

&gt; Given that being trans is not a pathology, psychiatry’s place in trans healthcare today should be limited to working with mental health concerns, which are faced by trans people inequitably due to stigma, lack of support, discrimination and prejudice...

&gt; In conclusion, the RANZCP position runs directly counter to the well-established evidence base that gender affirmation improves health outcomes and strengthens quality of life. Unreasonable barriers to access and outdated and harmful arbitrary protocols, can only lead to poorer health and wellbeing outcomes for trans people across the lifespan, including young people. Unfortunately, some trans people lose their life through suicide due to the lack of access or denial of appropriate healthcare and
gender affirming treatment.





Who are the people behind the anti-trans movement in Australia and New Zealand? I'll fill this in as I learn more

&gt; Dr D’Angelo is one of six psychiatrists to put their names to a letter in the journal BMJ Open. “Are families actually told, ‘we’re still not sure this (affirmative model) treatment is the best way to treat gender dysphoria’?”

&gt; There is concern about possible social contagion in rapidly ­increasing numbers of teenagers, chiefly girls, declaring trans identity with no childhood hint of gender confusion, and undergoing novel treatments with puberty- blocker drugs, cross-sex hormones and sometimes surgery.

### Genspect

[Genspect](https://genspect.org) is an anti-trans organisation dedicated to preventing trans youth accessing care, and instead [promote conversion therapy](https://genspect.org/finally-some-clarity-on-conversion-therapy/), or as they like to put it

&gt; Genspect is an international alliance of parent and professional groups whose aim is to advocate for parents of gender-questioning children and young people. Parents are concerned that their kids are not receiving appropriate treatment and support; many do not feel free to speak out about their concerns.

Conversion therapy is a horrific practice with serious long term consequences, including suicide

* https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy - *"So-called “conversion therapy,” sometimes known as “reparative therapy,” is a range of dangerous and discredited practices that falsely claim to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. Such practices have been rejected by every mainstream medical and mental health organization for decades, but due to continuing discrimination and societal bias against LGBTQ people, some practitioners continue to conduct conversion therapy. Minors are especially vulnerable, and conversion therapy can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide."*

This event will unite groundbreaking professionals at the heart of the debate around gender: Dr. David Bell, ex-governor at the UK’s Tavistock &amp; Portman NHS Trust; Dr. Lisa Littman, author of the seminal 2018 study on ROGD; and Genspect’s founder, psychotherapist and bestselling author Stella O’Malley."

They consisted of her interrogating me, asking me how I figured out I had incongruencies with my body and gender identity, in which she even took the opportunities to gaslight me and say they were gender stereotypes I was striving for and it is an invalid material measure on the matter of gender dysphoria (ie shaving my legs or wearing feminine clothes). She was insistent I should social transition for at least a year before getting HRT. She wrote back to Dr. Rhys saying that my desire to medically transition was an autistic hyperfixation and it should not be indulged. She also put me on a waiting list for a gender specialising psychiatrist, which has a waiting list until August."*

I guess? She found this psychologist and he was the most damaging psychologist I ever had the unpleasant experience of meeting. I was barely 18 and he basically convinced me to discuss my sexual fantasies with him even though I was uncomfortable with this. He told me, “you should be seeing yourself in the female position” in sex fantasies. He’d have this creepy smirk on his face when he would listen to me… he complimented me on how feminine I looked (after I expressed suicidal tendencies and begged to me voluntarily admitted to a psych ward as I was worried I’d take my own life, he looked at me as if “oh man, that’s too much paperwork” and told me, “hang in there”) and he was confused when I got upset. Mum thought YT was “good for me” because of the fact I’d be inconsolably crying under my computer desk after the sessions, she thought it meant “he was getting to the root of the issue” instead of just “agreeing with me and giving me what I want.” Parents just don’t get it. I dropped him after that."*

She instead decided to treat my “symptoms” of gender dysphoria as if it were depression and prescribed me anti-depressants...
