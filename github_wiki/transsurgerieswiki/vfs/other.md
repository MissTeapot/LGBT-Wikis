To note, I did not experience any form of discrimination, prejudice &amp; 'technical' or 'paperwork' issues as being a trans person. My experience is limited to this particular surgery &amp; appointments. It costed me 1 lakh 5 thousand rupees in semi-private ward. This included all the hospital costs : surgery, bed charge, medications, and all. The total hospital bill for staying four days. I initially planned to stay in General Ward, but it was not vacant that day. The initial plan was also to stay overnight after the surgery. However, I stayed for four days due to my experience post-surgery."*
