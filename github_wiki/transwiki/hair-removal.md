**Hair Removal**

*****

The main site for hair removal on Internet is [hairtell.com](https://hairtell.com/) and its associated site [hairfacts.com](https://www.hairfacts.com/), but its seems underutilized used by trans people and I think something more focussed on our needs would be helpful.

### Body Hair

The standard approach to removing body hair is laser hair removal. HRT will reduce body hair significantly, but not all of it. Surgery, either orchectomy or SRS will further reduce body hair. Laser works best on black hair on white skin. The more contrast the better. It doesn't work on white or red hair, or with black skin. Anyone saying otherwise is probably trying to rip you off. IPL machines are generally said to perform poorly, but are cheap.

# Hair Removal Technologies

* **Electrolysis** is the gold standard. When done properly it will permanently remove hair and it will never come back. The disadvantages are its very time consuming (typically 100-200 hours over 1 to  years), very expensive (in the region of $100 per hour), and for many very painful (more than laser). There are several technologies used, galvanic, thermolysis, and blend. See [HairFacts Electrolysis (electrology) for hair removal](https://www.hairfacts.com/hair-removal-methods/electrolysis/) and [HairTell Professional Electrolysis Forum](https://hairtell.com/forum/c/hair-removal-methods/professional-electrolysis)
* **Laser** - There's arguments about just how permanent laser hair removal is, but it seems to get rid of most hair for at least some considerable time. Its often recommended to start with laser and when it is not longer effective finish off with electrolysis. The advantage of laser is that its a lot cheaper and faster than electrolysis and usually a lot less painful. From what I've read it may be a mistake to use laser as treated hair could be slowly coming back for many years, but its hard to go past the benefits and I've done it myself.
* **Epilators** have a rotary device to catch the hair and rip it out. They are not permanent, but are cheap and effective. And incredibly painful the first few times you do it. If you keep at it the pain will disappear, tuning into a more of a tickle. Do not use an epilator on your face or public hair. Apart from being extremely painful it can damage the hair follicles making electrolysis even more difficult when you finally do it. And whatever you do keep it well away from your nipples. See [HairTell Rotary Epilator Forum](https://hairtell.com/forum/c/hair-removal-methods/rotary-epilators).
* **IPL**
* **Shaving** is clearly cheap and easy place to start, but not very effective and you'll need to get good at make up to hide the blue beard shadow.
* **Eflornithine/Vaniqa** is a medication used to temporarily suppress hair growth. Expensive. See [HairTell Vaniqa Forum](https://hairtell.com/forum/c/hair-removal-methods/prescription-topical-vaniqa).

## Electrolysis vs Laser

Electrolysis is guaranteed. At the end of it your hair will be gone and it won't come back. Laser is not, and its not clear to what extent. I've seen some people say laser works well and others that it all comes back, and there appears some risk that it may continue to regrow years later. However electrolyis is much slower, and is far more painfull for most, and can be intolerable for a minority. Its also far more expensive than laser - you could be looking at $10k-$20k. Hence most start with laser and hope it works, with the aim of finishing off whatever is left with electrolysis.

&amp;nbsp;
### Inflammation

Ibuprofen is often recommended for pain and to reduce skin irritation/swelling. However if you really have a problem with irritation and swelling then prednisolone/prednisone are prescription medications that are *far* more effective. These are drugs where you should consult a doctor first even if you can get them elsewhere as they have significant side effects - and don't take them any longer than you need to.

&amp;nbsp;
### Mass Clearance

There's are a number of electrologists offering facial mass clearance (especially with anesthetics injections or IV) where in a single session over one or more days they will remove all facial hair.

I've been told that if you have a high density of facial hair this can cause permanent scarring - when hairs are closer than 3mm apart then only partial electrolysis should be done, where every 2nd or even 3rd hair is removed, and the sessions should be spaced apart. This extends the time required to remove the hair, and if you need to travel to one of these places it will put the cost up.

If you travel to one of these places then you should be able to do a full clearance once per hair growth cycle - ie once every 3 months.

It is the only topical prescription treatment that slows the growth of facial hair. It is applied in a thin layer twice daily, a minimum of eight hours between applications. In clinical studies with Vaniqa, 81% percent of women showed clinical improvement after twelve months of treatment. Positive results were seen after eight weeks.[21] However, discontinuation of the cream caused regrowth of hair back to baseline levels within 8 weeks."*

# Pain Management

***I'm not a doctor and some of what follows is dangerous. I'm documenting what I've found in researching electrolysis - don't trust that its correct or do anything stupid. That what doctors are for.***

Some people find electrolysis (and laser) quite easy to tolerate and a lucky few can sleep though it. Others cry though it, and a few can't even get that far. Most appear to find electrolysis more painful than laser, but some are the other way around. There's only one way to find out.

There's a few easy things that can help reduce pain.

* Avoid coffee for at least 24 hours before electrolysis.
* Be rested and relaxed. Get a good nights sleep and don't go in stressed.
* Be hydrated (drink lots of water) and look after your skin.
* Some find listening to music helps.
* Stop taking estrogen before electrolysis (see reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/u3ujjy/electrolysis_breakthrough/))

## Intravenous Drugs

A few places offer intravenous and/or injected drugs for pain relief, but you'd be lucky to live near one of these and may have to travel. These places can offer complete clearance of facial hair in one session (you need multiple of these). These drugs are dangerous and only doctors are allowed to use them.

[O2 CLinic](https://www.o2clinic.be/en/treatments/beauty-skin-hair/hair-removal/electrolysis-hair-removal/) in Belgium offer [intravenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy) drugs.

&gt; In our clinic, we work with a patient controlled pain pump (PCA, patient controlled analgesia) which reduces the pain to zero. We are unique in the world to offer this pump for electrolysis. The computerised pump called the patient-controlled analgesia pump contains a strong pain killer that is also used in general anaesthesia ([remifentanil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remifentanil)) and is connected directly to the patient with an intravenous (IV) catheter line.

The [Zukowski Center](https://www.mlzukowskiffs.com/portfolio/large-volume-electrolysis/) in the USA use IV and injections

&gt; The trick is that we start an IV on you, and administer a light dose of anti-pain and anti-anxiety intravenous medication to immediately relax you and make you sleepy.  Nerve blocks with two types of long acting mixed local numbing medications is then performed, followed by a field block with the same local numbing medication. The sedation makes this comfortable.  If you feel discomfort at some point, further local numbing medication is used.


### Numbing skin with Ice

Ice applied to the skin (in a bag) prior to anesthetics can be used to reduce the injection pain. This is done at Yanhee Hospital in Thailand prior to electrolysis.

### PISTOR Eliance

Unfortunately its very expensive (3600 euro) and I/ve not heard of anyone using it for electrolysis. It may also not be suitiable, as its marketed towards [Mesotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesotherapy).

## Opiates

Every professional electrologist will tell you not to take strong drugs like opiates. Its not that the likes of [endone/oxycodone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone) don't work (they do), but problems and limitations are many and serious.

* They are dangerous and addictive.
* You can't drive home afterwards. You probably can't work for the rest of the day, and may depending on your work you may not be able to work the day or two after (they totally mess up your concentration).
* You need to spend a  lot of hours doing electrolysis and you'll quickly become tolerant to the drugs way before you get very far into hair removal, and then they won't work at all. To get the same effect you'd need to continually increase the dosage, which is dangerous and increases the risk of addiction (and your Dr is going to seriously question this).

## Light Sensitive Medications

There's a number of drugs than can cause photosensitivity and serious reactions when having laser, including the [Ibuprofen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen), [Celebrex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib), and other [NSAIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug), and the anesthetic [benzocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzocaine).

The slow onset also results in a more painful injection when used as a sole agent because one cannot practically ‘freeze ahead of the needle’; the recipient, therefore, feels the needle tip traversing throughout the tissues being infiltrated, a painful experience. In addition, bupivacaine, similar to lidocaine, is commercially supplied as an acidic solution, especially those prepared with epinephrine; the acidity contributes to injection pain."*

# Genital Hair Removal

Some surgeons do not require genital hair removal before SRS, saying its not necessary, and certainly in the vast majority of cases its not. However as far as I can determine all surgeons that use hair bearing skin internally have cases where vaginal hair occurrs, and it can be next to impossible to remove.

Although uncommon, in bad cases internal hair can lead to recurring infections. There was unusually bad case was posted on susans around 2016/2017 from PAI (removed by the moderators) where the women had reccurring infections and was looking at having her entire vaginal lining surgically removed. Most women don't have any internal hair, but there seems to be a small percentage that do. I don't think there are enough cases to be certain of the risks with any surgeon.

There's a lot of post-op women saying its not its not necessary, because they didn't have internal hair. Not surprising, as the risk is around around 7% from one paper (when removed by the surgeon). However, is 1 in 14 an acceptable risk to you?

Due to hair growing in cycles it takes a very long time to remove properly. If you removed all of it in each cycle (so about once every month or two) you'd need a year. In practice doing a full clearance right at the start probably won't happen. To be assured its gone you need to count from when full clearance occurs and make sure it stays that way for a year. Worse there's not a 100% kill rate of hair, so just because its gone doesn't mean it won't come back in a year - you'd want to wait another year to catch those hairs on the next cycle. Anything less increases the risk of hair, and how much risk you're prepared to accept.

Laser and/or elecrolysis are used to remove genital hair. I find it hard to believe that laser is an acceptable method of genital hair removal as there's so many reports of it not being permanent on the face.

As surgeon should have a diagram of the areas where hair will need to be removed. Note that hair can be useful to hide scarring, so you may not want to remove all public hair, just the parts that will end up inside. You can always remove the hair later when you know if and where you have scars you want to hide.

Some surgeons say that electrolysis can damage the skin qualiity and reccomend against it. This would presumably be another reason to get it done well before surgery, or use laser.

These reddit posts are interesting, showing very clearly what grafted skin with hair looks like.

I wish that she would have been honest with me and told me to delay my surgery and get a bit smoother results from the Electrolysis first... hair in the vagina is a very very very normal Bowers result, because she always insists that she can do the follicle scrape and the in operating room hair removal, and she always says that it's okay with a little bit of hair.

&gt; Preoperative  hair  removal is essential. The key areas in which to remove hair follicles are the scrotum and penile shaft. We also  clear  a  1/2  inch   area   around   the   base   of   the   penis.   Inadequate  hair removal results in  hair  growth  inside the vagina. This is bothersome, unsightly, and   difficult   to   correct   postoperatively. ... At  surgery, any residual hair follicles are excised using surgical loupes and a small curved  iris  scissors.  Through this multimodal approach  (electrolysis,  laser,  and  direct excision), we are able to achieve adequate hair follicle clearance in all of our patients.

## Post-op Hair removal

Some of the above links have information on hair removal post-op, in particular those by u/SeanaTG aka u/ElectrolysisBySeana (she's a [Canadian electrologist](http://www.electrolysisbyseana.com/)). It sounds very difficult, but not necessarily impossible. I'm not sure, but it may require cauterisation instead of electrolysis.

There's a couple of posts on susans by KayXo, who managed to permanently remove deep vaginal hair after using [Nair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nair_(hair_removal)) at the suggestion of her surgeon Dr Brassard. See [here](https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,220964.msg1958452.html#msg1958452), [here](https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,223149.msg1976373.html#msg1976373), and [here](https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,223149.msg1976533.html#msg1976533).

### Cauterization

I have heard of cauterisation being used to remove hair, but it was by a surgeon and presumably an surgical electrocauterisation tool was used. It was only once, and I don't know the result. Perhaps a gynocoloist may have the equipment and be able to do that same. Electrolysis slides a very thin probe down the side of the hair to kill it, and I would assume that cauterisation burns a much larger hole where the hair is, and that there might be a risk of infection afterwards.

[Silver nitrate sticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caustic_pencil) have been suggested (once) as being used, but it doesn't seem likely they would be able to cauterise to the depth required to permanently kill hair ([this post](https://hairtell.com/forum/t/depth-of-insertion/38491/3) suggests 1 to 3mm).

Electrolysis machines can use probes that burn off skin tags, so it may be possible to use them for causterisation. The difficulty with electrolsis normally for deep hair that its not possible to insert the probe in due to angle of the hair at depth (normally you'd just change the probe angle and stretch the skin).

&amp;nbsp;
## A surgeons point of view

SRS surgeon [Dr Sidhbh Gallagher's](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/transsurgerieswiki/srs/usa-south.md#wiki_sidhbh_gallagher) YouTube video [Why We No Longer Require Hair Removal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeAMGjtJZxY) is interesting as it shows a surgeons point of view. After visiting a conference and attending a workshop by surgeon Kathy Rumer, who does *"really beautiful work"* and who *"does not require any sort of hair removal before surgery"* she no longer requires hair removal. Dr Rumer is not seeing a problem in the long term in her practice. Sidhbh Gallagher does penile inversion and uses *"scrotal skin to line the deepest part of the vagina"*.

In her video Gallagher quotes a 2006 survey of 232 post-op women, [Patient-reported complications and functional outcomes of male-to-female sex reassignment surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17109225) by Anne Lawrence, in which *"only 7% of patients had significant problems with hair growth in the vagina"* and a *"bit over half of the patients who are having the serious problems had undergone a lot of electrolysis before their surgery"* so hair removal *"doesn't really seem to make a difference"*. Therefore she is no longer requiring patients to undergo laser hair removal and hair removal is optional (since March 2018). Note that she does have patients [with vaginal hair](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM8sUroekoGpvlgSE-3WRxWxg2z9_a_Z0_xVgvWhtkGV6c7zfqrC5-x07E2-EYQzw?key=c3FURkdfMzl1azRTZVZpamZrOHl3SlNkazBndWtR). The 7% statistic appears to come from the the paper saying *"Among the 17 participants reporting the most serious vaginal hair problems"*.

Personally I think that paper is a warning to do electrolysis properly rather than taking shortcuts (as some do), and that no surgeon informs patient of the risks associated with their choices. The hair growth cycle for genital hair is 10 months (vs 14 for chin) according to the [Richards-Merhag table](https://hairfreelife.com/life-hair-anagen-categen-telogen-phases/). You'd need at least one cycle to completely remove all hair (possibly multiples of that if you missed any). There's another potential issue that increases in hormone levels can simulate previously dormant folicles causing new hair growth.

Futher information on Dr Sidhbh Gallagher can be found in this wiki [here](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/transsurgerieswiki/srs/usa.md#wiki_sidhbh_gallagher).

As an aside, Anne Lawrence is [notorious in the trans community](http://www.tsroadmap.com/info/anne-lawrence.html).

 As of 17 April 2022, SRS surgeon **Dr Kathy Rumer** sayson her [website](https://rumergendersurgery.com/gender-reassignment-surgery/vaginoplasty-techniques) (with my itallics)

&gt;  Dr. Rumer performs a One-Stage Modified Penile Inversion Vaginoplasty which results in an authentic appearance with excellent depth, function and sensation. In addition, *Dr. Rumer’s Vaginoplasty technique does not require electrolysis or laser hair removal of the genital area before surgery, and there is NO regrowth.*

However in the lawsuit [THOMPSON v. RUMER](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/7820076/22/thompson-v-rumer/) filed Feb 1, 2020 Dr Rumer argues (again with my itallics)

&gt; Defendants Kathy L. Rumer D.O., F.A.C.O.S. and Delaware Valley Aesthetics, PLLC d/b/a Rumer Cosmetic Surgery will prove that they complied with the standard of care in performing Roxanne Thompson's gender reassignment surgery on September 13, 2016. *Hair regrowth is a recognized complication of vaginoplasty. Complete hair removal, whether it is done pre-operatively or post-operatively is never guaranteed.* There are differing schools of thought on the subject of hair removal when performing gender reassignment surgery."

Futher information on Dr Kather Rumer can be found in this wiki [here](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/transsurgerieswiki/srs/usa.md#wiki_kathy_lynn_rumer).

* [Frightening experience with Dr. Zukowski](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/13pwcrs/frightening_experience_with_dr_zukowski/) by birdsandsnakes in 2023 - *Yesterday, I went for high volume hair removal at the Cirine Hair Removal. They're associated with the Zukowski Center, and Dr Zukowski gives medical support — the deal is, he sedates you and gives you lidocaine injections to numb your face, and then they do a very long electrolysis session. I had a really scary experience. Shortly after my third set of lidocaine injections, I'd gone for a bathroom break, when suddenly I found myself disoriented, losing control of my limbs, having a hard time walking, seeing double, and struggling to put sentences together. I made it out of the bathroom and asked an electrologist to call 911 — I could no longer use my phone to do it myself — but they refused. Instead, they called Dr Zukowski back. He tried to convince me I was having a panic attack. (I've had panic attacks. This was not a panic attack.) At this point, my arms and legs were twitching uncontrollably, and I couldn't stand or walk without help. He insisted that this was my fault, and that I'd feel better if I relaxed. Eventually, he gave me some kind of intravenous medication that stopped the attack. I've since learned that those were [symptoms of a lidocaine overdose, which could have progressed to seizures or coma](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lidocaine-overdose).*

HOWEVER, Dr. Zukowski made comments that made me never want to go back (he put in iv, gave controlled drugs, and lidocaine injections). We were discussing my weight loss and FFS and he was upset I never got a consult with him. Then he made a comment he could have made me 10x prettier, and I started crying. It was an absolutely horrible experience with him. But the electrolysis staff are on point, friendly, and professional. Dr. Z really disappointed me with his demeanor today, made me feel worthless, ugly, and frankly just put me in a depressed mood. For a Doctor dealing with a population already hypercritical of their physical bodies, the comments he made were….ugh."*

* [Frightening experience with Dr. Zukowski](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/13pwcrs/frightening_experience_with_dr_zukowski/) by birdsandsnakes in 2023 - *Yesterday, I went for high volume hair removal at the Cirine Hair Removal. They're associated with the Zukowski Center, and Dr Zukowski gives medical support — the deal is, he sedates you and gives you lidocaine injections to numb your face, and then they do a very long electrolysis session. I had a really scary experience. Shortly after my third set of lidocaine injections, I'd gone for a bathroom break, when suddenly I found myself disoriented, losing control of my limbs, having a hard time walking, seeing double, and struggling to put sentences together. I made it out of the bathroom and asked an electrologist to call 911 — I could no longer use my phone to do it myself — but they refused. Instead, they called Dr Zukowski back. He tried to convince me I was having a panic attack. (I've had panic attacks. This was not a panic attack.) At this point, my arms and legs were twitching uncontrollably, and I couldn't stand or walk without help. He insisted that this was my fault, and that I'd feel better if I relaxed. Eventually, he gave me some kind of intravenous medication that stopped the attack. I've since learned that those were [symptoms of a lidocaine overdose, which could have progressed to seizures or coma](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lidocaine-overdose).*
