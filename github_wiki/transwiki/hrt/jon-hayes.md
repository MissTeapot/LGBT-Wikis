**Dr Jonathan Hayes**

*****

I created this page after the resignation of the Sydney endocrinologist ***Dr Jonathan (Jon) Hayes*** in 2019. Dr Jonathan Hayes was a world leader in trans HRT and his resignation has affected me quite badly. I never want to be in this situation again.

Dr Jonathan Hayes abrupt resignation in 2019 left thousands of Sydney transgender people without a doctor for HRT. A meeting was held at [ACON](https://www.acon.org.au/) on 4 July 2019 and attended by 60+ physicians with the aim of getting together to sort this out. ACON have done an incredible job supporting the NSW trans community and it looks like we've come out of this in a much stronger position with a large number of doctors now supporting HRT and implants.

Facebook is the primary source for a lot of this information, and in particular the group [NovaTrue](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NovaTrue/permalink/2130966700533462/). However, *I won't reproduce posts from Facebook without explicit permission.

From part 2, some key points are

* *In the first half of August, a group of GPs will begin a shared care model for maintaining trans &amp; gender diverse care. This will include the prescription of estrogen implants, and also the insertion of pellets. Importantly, the aim will be to keep trans &amp; gender diverse patients on the same levels they’re accustomed to with Jon Hayes.*
* *It is understood that so far about 16 N.S.W. based medical professionals have come forward to offer their services on a formal list.*
* Taylor Square - best read it yourself.

On the NovaTrue Facebook group (September 2019) there are reports that Dr Hayes may be coming back, possibly via a new doctor. Hayes had placed an [advertisement for a GP](https://www.seek.com.au/job/39732371) on Seek

***Ted Cook of ACON*** posted on Facebook covering the background of these events, [An update from Ted Cook, ACON’s Manager, Trans &amp; Gender Diverse Health Equity](https://www.facebook.com/aconhealth/posts/an-update-from-ted-cook-acons-manager-trans-gender-diverse-health-equity-i-wante/10158601175798222/). His contact details are on the post.


Dr Hayes often used 200mg implants, and these have the potential to raise your estrogen levels to supraphysiological levels (above typical cis-women levels). There's a pdf document discussing this [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/woogsaskw82zfc7/AABTAkefJG21zYR_K1qZQ0oya/12%20-%20Implants%20and%20Supraphysiological%20Estradiol%20Levels.pdf?dl=0).

# Getting Your Hayes Medical History

You should try to get your medical history to give to your new doctor. You can request it from Dr Hayes via email at reception.drjonhayes@gmail.com, but there is a time limit so don't leave it. He is sending them out, but there's no telling when you'll get them. Some have, but many have not. 

If you don't have your history from Dr Hayes, and need it, follow these instructions (from Facebook)

&gt; Please contact Douglas Hanley Moir Pathology on 02 9855 5222, and ask for your recent blood results to be sent to your new doctor (and you as well).  If you are on estrogen implants, please also email Complementary Compounding Services for your implant history on sales@custommedicine.com.au. Please use the subject: Pellet History, let them know you were a patient of Dr Hayes, provide the name listed with Medicare and your actual name (if these are different), and they will forward you a copy of your record.

If some of your estrogen implant history is missing and you want it for some reason Stenlake may have it.

If shouldn't be necessary, but there's a good post on this [Getting your past pathology results](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderau/comments/cbcvcn/getting_your_past_pathology_results/) by AlpacaActually.

I think its a good idea to always keep copies of all medical test results. I already had at least the last 10 years of mine. I didn't think of the implants prescriptions though, or the vitamin D injections I was getting.

# 200mg Implants Triage

Of historical interest only this this point, there was a implant triage survey posted on Facebook on 11 July 2019 by Ted Cook of [ACON Health](https://www.acon.org.au/) for those who have been on 200mg implants and who are experiencing difficulty. You can still sign up for it and will be contacted, but there's no real need anymore. ACON has [published a list of doctors](https://www.acon.org.au/who-we-are-here-for/tgd-people/#acons-gender-affirming-doctor-list) who will prescribe implants and you can contact them directly. However, ***do not do this at the moment if you don't need them as they are busy working through the most urgent cases first***. There's no longer any need for concern (or panic) - new GP's have already started doing implants and it shouldn't be difficult to get them later on.

&gt; Hi all \*Please Share\*
&gt; We are asking that all trans women and non-binary people assigned male at birth, who are on 200mg estrogen implants and are seeking access to care, to please fill out this survey.
This survey has been developed by Ted Cook, ACON's Manager Trans &amp; Gender Diverse Health Equity, Dr Michelle Guttman-Jones, the doctor leading and coordinating the medical response team, Dr Portia Predny and a number of Sydney-based GPs offering gender affirming hormonal care for trans and gender diverse people.
We are working together to connect patients with doctors who can provide continuity of care for Dr Hayes’’s patients. The use of 200mg implants is not a widely accepted medical practice, however, there are doctors in Sydney who have chosen to provide 200mg implants to patients who had been receiving them from Dr Hayes.
The decision has been made to prioritize those whose mental health is being most impacted by falling levels. When the most urgent have been seen, the doctors will catch up with insertions in order of implant due date.
Please be honest and indicate if you are feeling OK, and make space for people at risk of harm if they wait.
Please note that you won't hear anything until at least the week starting Monday 29 July so please stay tuned. If you are experiencing symptoms of low estrogen, please see your doctor for some interim estrogen patches.
