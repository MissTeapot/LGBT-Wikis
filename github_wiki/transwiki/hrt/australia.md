**HRT in Australia**

This is mainly about MTF, although the the doctors and psych's medical professionals may be the same. I don't know anything about FTM, but I'm willing to add it if someone can help.

# Referrals

You can see any GP without a referral, but if you want to seen a sepcialist like an endocronologist or psychaitrist you'll need a referral from a GP. You can go without an referral, but you'll have to pay the full price, and its expensive.

A normal referral only lasts one year. If you expect to see the specialist for longer than that you should ask for an *indefintie referral* which do not expires. As HRT is for life you should be looking for an indefinte referral to see one. If they GP refuses to give you an indefinte referral its an ethical red flag, and personally I don't want someone like that as my doctor.

&gt; **Referral periods from a GP to a specialist**

&gt;  A referral from a general practitioner (GP) to a specialist lasts 12 months, unless noted otherwise. The referral starts from the date the specialist first meets the patient, not the date issued.

&gt; If a patient needs continuing care, GPs can write a referral beyond 12 months or for an indefinite period.

&gt; If a patient on an indefinite referral has a new or unrelated condition, the GP must issue a new referral for that condition.

# Visiting Australia from Overseas


## Traveller's Exemption

As of Feb 2020

https://www.tga.gov.au/entering-australia

&gt; The *traveller's exemption* allows people entering Australia to carry their medicines and medical devices with them for their own personal use or the use by an immediate family member who is travelling with them, such as an infant.
&gt;
&gt; Follow these simple rules to make sure you don't get caught up at the border:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Don't bring medicines or medical devices into Australia for anyone other than yourself or an immediate family member.
&gt; 2. For prescription medicines, **bring the prescription with you** or have a letter from your doctor that outlines what you are taking and how much you are bringing with you. Australian residents must have a valid prescription for the medicine from an Australian doctor.
&gt; 3. **Keep the original packaging** for your medicines and medical devices intact so they can be easily identified.
&gt; 4. Do not bring more than a **3 month supply** with you.
&gt; 5. Check what medicines need to be declared at the border at the Department of Home Affairs website on the [Arriving into Australia webpage](https://www.abf.gov.au/entering-and-leaving-australia/can-you-bring-it-in). You must declare any medicines which may be subject to abuse or misuse. This includes steroids, strong pain medicines, cannabis and other restricted medicines.
&gt; 6. Injections that contain material of human or animal origin, such as growth hormone, require special permission to bring into the country. An Australian doctor must organise access for you through the Special Access Scheme. You do not need permission to bring insulin with you for personal use.

# Help Improve The Wiki

Please help add to this collection of information. It benefits all of us.

I'm especially in interested in

* Corrections
* Recommendations for or against any medical professional
* If you know any doctors who are not listed here and who will do implants, or you think might be persuaded to do so, please let me know.

I usually see most trans related posts, but please also

* reply to one of my posts/comments
* just type /u/HiddenStill in a post/comment
* pm me (however I prefer to have information public so I can link to it).


Personally I'd try to avoid doctors who do not prescribe implants even if I didn't currently want them. It suggests to me that they are not serious about trans health care, and as a community I think its in our interests to support the more progressive doctors.

# Estrogen Injections

Estrogen injections are not common in Australia, but can be sourced from some [Compounding Pharmacies in Australia](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/transwiki/compounding-pharmacies/australia.md) (with a doctors prescription).

Syringes and needles are available without prescription in Australia. You should be able to get them from a pharmacy, but there's also online medical suppliers where you can order them. I can't speak from personal experience, but you could look at

* https://www.medshop.com.au
* https://www.livingstone.com.au - I've seen some bad reviews for this place

# Testosterone

Testosterone can be prescribed by a GP, endocronologist, or sexual health physician, but there's a significiant cost difference. With a GP means you'll pay the private script price which is expensive. You can only get the cheaper PBS cost via an endocronologist/sexual health physician.

This means it can only be prescribed under the PBS, in any form (like gels, shots, whatever), if you have an "authority" - an exemption. Without an authority, you pay a private script price (i.e., more). For t, this authority can only be given by an endocrinologist (or other related specialist) for a diagnosed "androgen deficiency"... For reference, I'm on [Testogel](https://www.pbs.gov.au/medicine/item/10380H)and it costs me $6.80 for a 30 day supply (because I'm poor). The full PBS cost, or what your average person with Medicare would pay (which should include you guys), is around $40. For a private script (a script that isn't dispensed under the PBS), it's around $77. To research prices, you can find all you need to know about testosterone [on the PBS website](https://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/search?term=testosterone&amp;search-type=medicines&amp;analyse=false) \- the DPMQ is the 'private script price' and the 'general patient charge' is what someone with Medicare would pay."*

Dr Hayes has prescribed the topical Androfeme 1 cream and testosterone implants to post-op transwomen.

# Progesterone

Not every doctor in Australia will prescribe progesterone, but many will. NUGen Pharmacy in Sydney appear to be the most popular and cheapest source of bioidentical progesterone and ship interstate. You will need a prescription.

* https://www.nugenpharmacy.com.au/

Typical doses of bioidentical progesterone are one 100mg or 200mg capsule once or twice a way.

You may also come across the synthetic progesterone [Medroxyprogesterone Acetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medroxyprogesterone_acetate) or MPA. Its much cheaper, but carries a risk of serious depression and mood problems. Personally I'd not risk it.

# Informed Consent

Some doctors now now follow the [informed consent](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/transsurgerieswiki/index#wiki_informed_consent.md) model, meaning you can get HRT prescribed just like anyone else can get medical care. No psych.

You may be asked to sign one or more multi-page documents informing you of the risks of what you are doing.

If you need to see a psychiatrist for a HRT or surgery letter, see the [Australian Psychs &amp; Therapists](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/transsurgerieswiki/psychs/australia.md) page.
