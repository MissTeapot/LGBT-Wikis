https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic - *"A local anesthetic (LA) is a medication that causes absence of pain sensation. In the context of surgery, a local anesthetic creates an absence of pain in a specific location of the body without a loss of consciousness, as opposed to a general anesthetic. When it is used on specific nerve pathways (local anesthetic nerve block), paralysis (loss of muscle power) also can be achieved."*

# Topical Anesthetics

[EMLA cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine/prilocaine) is applied to the skin and usually covered with a plastic food wrap. Its the weakest topical anesthetic I've come across. Its a 5% emulsion containing 2.5% each of lidocaine/prilocaine. Some find it helps, other find it does nothing.

Topical anesthetics

* [Lidocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine)
* [Tetracaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracaine)
* [Benzocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzocaine)


Be careful using topical anesthetics as a couple of women died in the USA using them, and covering and wrapping heir entire legs and wrapping them in preparation or laser hair removal. And some topical anesthetics are far stronger than the ones they used. It's probably extremely dangerous to use strong topicals on large body areas (ie laser or entire face); keep it to the minimum possible.

Its probably a good idea to test these stronger topical anesthetics on a small patch a patch of skin before using them on your face. Some of them can cause irritation to sensitive skin.

A common formulation of topical anesthetic is **BLT cream**, containing Benzocaine 20%, Lidocaine 6%, and Tetracaine 4%. The percentages seem to vary slightly, but there's a limit of 30% total, I believe set by the PCCA.

Another less common, but more powerful variation, **LT cream** with 23% Lignocaine, Tetracaine 7% (again note the limit of 30%).

The more lidocaine the more effective the topical anesthetic will be, but unfortunately lidocaine is toxic and the stronger formulations are more dangerous. Try to use weakest one that works and cover as little area as possible. People have ended up in hospital due to lidocaine.

Apart from safety lidocaine is often mixed with other topical anesthetics as its quite slow to take effect. This is not necessarily a problem with electrolysis, if you're prepared to wait.

An ingredient sometimes seen in topical anesthetics is [Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide) at around 10%. This chemical transports anesthetics through though the skin, plus whatever else happens to be on your skin, so make sure everything is very clean (and no soap residue). Its also a strong solvent, dissolving many plastics and rubber, which you don't want to transported through your skin. Note that because DMSO increases the concentration of lignocaine in your body it also increases the risk. Higher concentrations of DMSO are presumably more effective, but can/will cause severe skin irritation/burns. You may get away with 20%, but maybe not. Not too surprising when you realise that DMSO is also used as [paint stripper](https://www.gaylordchemical.com/literature/dmso-for-paint-stripping/).


Dr Powers topical anesthetic (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/fibnrj/the_current_compendium_of_my_compounded_topical/)). Its unknown how effective this is compared to other strong topical anesthetics.  He keeps changing it so the below will be out of date

&gt; Ketamine 10%+DMSO 10%+Gaba 6%+Amitriptyline 2%+Baclofen 1%+Cyclo 1%+Diclo 1%+Lido7% +Tetra2%+Benzo5%

&gt; SIG: Apply 90 minutes before procedure, 30 minutes before procedure, and 15 minutes before procedure. Limit to 100 square cm treatment area.

&gt; This stuff shames EMLA, however you cant apply it to your whole body at once as its literally Ketamine and DMSO and well....yeah that would be unwise. Limit to treatment zone only and you're fine. One patient abused it and coated their entire anterior thorax in it and didn't have a good time.

I've never heard of it in practice, but according to papers [Epinephrine (adrenaline)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline) can be added to topical anesthetics to extend the duration of its effect (I've been refused this on the grounds that its too dangerous). I would guess that as with injections of lidocaine it also increases the allowable dosage. See [Alster 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4107876/).

 &gt; Epinephrine or another adrenergic agonist is often added to the local topical agent in order to prolong the anesthetic effects by increasing vasoconstriction and decreasing the rate of systemic absorption. Vasoconstriction increases the duration of time the agent is in contact with the nerve fibers; thus, prolonging the anesthetic effects

Note: Need to look into [Phenylephrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylephrine) which seems to be another vasoconstrictor. See [here](https://digitalcommons.unmc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=mdtheses).

Dr. P's pain cream contains Gabapentin, which is the same class of drug as Pregabalin, so I experimented with it. I tried a session with Dr.P's cream with Hydrocodone, and a second session with cream with Pregablin. It seems Pregablin works better personally for me. I drink 6-7 cups of coffee per day, and when I was on Pregablin I accidentally discovered coffee somehow activates the drug and modifies its effect and it introduces a state of calmness and disassociation. Basically I am attacking the pain from both inside and outside. Not too sure it will work without the typical cream. The cream is doing most of the heavy lifting, I think Pregablin orally simply made the pain slightly less and introduce calmness for the session. I was super relaxed and comfortable. lease be careful. You can get addicted to Pregablin and withdraw symptom allegedly is pretty awful.

# Injections

Lidocaine injections are somtimes used for electrolysis, always for hormone pellet implants, and many other minor surgcial procedures.

Some electrologists work near a dentist who's prepared to administer dental blocks that will numb the upper lip and mouth area. The upper lip is often the most painful area, so this can be a great help. The area of effect from a dental block is quite limited, and while is possible to administer (infiltrate) local anesthetics elsewhere into the skin a dentist is not qualified to do so and will refuse.

Drugs used by dentists are [lidocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine) and [articaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articaine), optionally with [epinephrine/adrenaline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine). Articaine is longer lasting and stronger than lidocaine (I don't know why its not standard). Preferably epinephrine is be used as it restricts the blood flow in the area making it last longer and reducing bleeding. If you have epinephrine you may start shaking and may find it difficult to stand for a short while afterwards.

It is possible (and effective) to inject (infiltrate) local anesthetic into the skin elsewhere in the face, but a dentist is not qualified to do so and will refuse (in Australia). Again there are not many places that can offer this service. In this case lidocaine is injected subcutaneously, about 3-5mm deep.

Lidocaine is normally safe (not always, hence the doctor) up to 0.3 mg per kg of body weight (i.e. 30 mg for a 100 Kg person), and when mixed with epinephrine the limit is 0.7mg per Kg. Injectable lidocaine is normally supplied in vials or ampules at either 10 or 20 mg/mL. The safe limit is therefore quite a small volume (even if its mixed with epinephrine), and well below what would be required for full facial clearance.

Lidocaine can be diluted with [saline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_\(medicine\)) for electrolysis. This has the advantage that larger areas can be safely anaesthetised (due to the lower dosage of lidocaine). Presumably the chance of having an adverse reaction would also be reduced.

Lidocaine can to at diluted (to at least 1 part of 2% lidocaine to 7 parts saline) for electrolysis. When buffering with sodium bicarbonate to reduce injection pain (see [implants/pellets](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/transwiki/hrt/implants.md)) it is mixed according to the volume of lidocaine used, not the total volume including saline.

The ratio of sodium bicarbonate to lidocaine recommended in papers is usually 1:10, but it varies down to about 3:1. Perhaps the acidity of the lidocaine used varies? It its dangerous to inject too much sodium bicarbonate, but I don't currently know what the limit is.

If you're having long electrolysis sessions and find this all stressful, [Zolpidem (Ambien)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolpidem) is quite a good drug to relax. It's quite strong (you might fall asleep), but only lasts about 4 hours (I'm not sure when its safe to drive afterwards). Most [benzodiazepines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) last much longer and you'd likely be affected after the session is over. These are prescription drugs.

HairTell has an interesting post with a [video of anasthetic injection for electrolysis](https://hairtell.com/forum/t/video-of-anasthetic-injection-for-electrolysis/40891), referring to the YouTube video [Electrolysis For Men Starring Howard Paul Shore Wednesday, March 2nd, 20161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNIB5TA_I9A) by HOWARD SHORE in 2016. The electrologists on HairTell are highly critical of the electrolysis tecnique, but I notice the lidocaine injection techniquie is also very poor.

* After the first injection subsequent injections should start from within the numbed area, then working out from withing the numbed area so that there's no additional pain. Instead she just picks lots of different places, maximising pain.
* The injections are performed at a very low angle, which increases pain by going through the maximum number of nerves. The first injection should be done at a 90° angle.
* Given the type of syringe, which looks like a dental syringe with cartridges, there's very little chance the lidocaine is buffered, increasing pain. It also won't be diluted, limiting the length of the session due to lidoaine toxicity.
* Rub the injected area afterwards to make it more effective.

They're associated with the Zukowski Center, and Dr Zukowski gives medical support — the deal is, he sedates you and gives you lidocaine injections to numb your face, and then they do a very long electrolysis session. I had a really scary experience. Shortly after my third set of lidocaine injections, I'd gone for a bathroom break, when suddenly I found myself disoriented, losing control of my limbs, having a hard time walking, seeing double, and struggling to put sentences together. I made it out of the bathroom and asked an electrologist to call 911 — I could no longer use my phone to do it myself — but they refused. Instead, they called Dr Zukowski back. He tried to convince me I was having a panic attack. (I've had panic attacks. This was not a panic attack.) At this point, my arms and legs were twitching uncontrollably, and I couldn't stand or walk without help. He insisted that this was my fault, and that I'd feel better if I relaxed. Eventually, he gave me some kind of intravenous medication that stopped the attack. I've since learned that those were [symptoms of a lidocaine overdose, which could have progressed to seizures or coma](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lidocaine-overdose).*

&amp;nbsp;
## Buffering Lidocaine

Injectable lidocaine is quite acidic and for some its very painful when injected before it takes effect (like injecting lemon juice). However it can be ***buffered*** with sodium bicarbonate to reduce the acidity and hence pain, and in my experience this eliminates the majority of pain associated with these injections. You still have the needle pain, but not the intense pain of the lidocaine; its very different. Although its easy to buffer lidocaine, most doctors won't bother - its a waste of time and its not like they feel anything. Most patients don't know about this either, so no problem.

I've had buffered lidocaine and it works very well. While I've not experienced it myself it appears to be possible to totally eliminate all pain with buffering, very fine needles, and different injection techniques - but that probably really is a waste of time unless you have some issue with it.

Lidocaine is not manufactured pre-buffered as it reduces the shelf life. However once mixed it can be stored for a reasonable length of time, weeks to months under suitable conditions according to the referenced papers.

### Safe Dosage of Sodium Bicarbonate

I can't find proper information on this, so I'll make a guess based on how its used to tread medical problems. In this document, [SODIUM BICARBONATE- sodium bicarbonate injection, solution General Injectables &amp; Vaccines, Inc](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=2d05e1e4-0891-411d-a435-1280991fa79f&amp;type=display) it says that for 8.4% Sodium Bicarbonate solution the is 1 mEq/mL, and *"The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to eight- hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient"*. I'll assume that this treament dose is "safe" (probably a really bad idea).

For a body weight of weight of 100kg, 2 mEq/Kg is a dosage of 200 mEq, or 200ml of 8.4% solution. Given that 100ml of injected saline would contain around 12 ml of lidocaine, and 1.2ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, there's around 100 times margin. This is also ignoring the reaction between the acidic lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate which I assume forms salt (NaCl), further increasing the margin.  Adjusting the ratio of  sodium bicarbonate to lidocaine (from 1:10 to 1:3 ) in this solution won't make much difference.

For patients who had previously undergone an unsuccessful procedure with bupivicaine (the standard local anesthetic used in our practice), the same procedure with mepivicaine provided good relief."* - PDF [here](https://www.painphysicianjournal.com/current/pdf?article=MTg3&amp;journal=16).

## Lidocaine vs Lignocaine

These are the same drug. Lignocaine is the old name for the drug in some countries, while Lidocaine is the 
[International nonproprietary name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_nonproprietary_name) (INN). Renaming has been taking place in some countries as part of standardisation.

* 2020 - [Updating medicine ingredient names](https://www.tga.gov.au/book-page/17-interim-decision-relation-lidocaine) - *"In different countries, different names are used to describe the same medicinal ingredient. Over the years, some medicine ingredient names in Australia became out of date. This can be confusing for Australian consumers and healthcare professionals who travel internationally, as well as people like doctors who have trained overseas or people trying to access medicine information online. We have updated some medicine ingredient names used in Australia to align with names used internationally. This has been done by some other countries over the years, including the United Kingdom in 2003 and New Zealand in 2008."*
* 2003 - [Name Changes of Medicines in UK](https://patient.info/treatment-medication/medicines-to-keep-at-home/name-changes-of-medicines-in-uk) - *"For many years the UK had its own naming system. Each medicine had a British Approved Name (BAN). However, European law says that medicines should be called the same in all EEC countries. So, the name of each medicine is now the recommended International Non-proprietary Name (rINN). As medicines are now named the same all over Europe, it should reduce the risk of medication errors."*

## Bupivacaine

Also known as Marcaine.

The key difference between bupuvicaine is its very long duration of action (2-8 hours) compared to lidocaine (0.5-3 hours). In principal this  would be an advantage if you were only able to get a single set of injections before electrolysis, however I'm not yet aware of anyone using this for electrolysis.

According to [this pdf](https://www.nps.org.au/assets/b30b3da46bda58bc-4fd5d12fa27b-3a8984e8aeae3c5511581beda69158bc983e692f06f684b5739e1c346dea.pdf) Bupivacaine is buffered at 0.1ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to to 20ml 0.25%-0.5% bupuvicaine, and it must be measured carefully to avoid precipitation.

*I need to investiate the max dose and possibility of dilution. Also I think I read that bupvicaine cannot be injected painlessly as it doesn't number as its injected in the way lidocaine does - but it can be mixed to lidocaine to achieve this.*

## Ropivacaine

Possibly longer duration than Bupivacaine.

As you said, much like injecting an epidural anesthetic directly into the spinal cord, injecting anesthetic into a peripheral nerve will cause permanent damage to the affected nerve.* ***Source: Neurology resident*** *who has performed a number of peripheral nerve blocks and gotten many talks from pain specialists about the ramifications of fucking up"*
