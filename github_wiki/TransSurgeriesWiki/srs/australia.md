Wayne Collings is suing plastic surgeon Peter Haertsch for allegedly failing to warn him of the risks involved. Dr Haertsch claims he should have known the risks after having thousands of pounds worth of facial surgery in the past. Mr Collings says the surgeon assured him the phalloplasty and dermal graft would increase the length of his penis by three centimetres. Instead, it left him with a shorter, painful and deformed penis as well as two months of sleepless nights caused by constant erections...*

I said my daughter is being operated on by DR Haertsch will she be ok? After my daughter was released from hospital in the morning she had a medical emergency that night due to his incompetence. Although Dr Haertsch performed surgery the next day, damage to tissue could not be saved due to blood loss. My daughter took her life in August last year. Dr Haertsch was suppose to give her the medical procedure she required to ensure that she lived a happy and long life. I have lost my daughter because of him.
