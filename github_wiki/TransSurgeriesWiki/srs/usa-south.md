Many doctors in Florida do not carry malpractice insurance. See the [wiki introduction](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/TransSurgeriesWiki/index#wiki_malpractice_insurance_in_the_usa.md) to see what this means.

I got to about half a liter of water and spent the next 3 hours trying to pee... I broke down crying because I just wanted to pee so badly and I felt like it was my fault that I couldn’t. I worked myself up into an anxiety attack and messaged the docs saying I couldn’t pee. They told me to come back in for another catheter and continued to blame me saying they’ve never had this issue before and there is no reason I shouldn’t be able to pee. Dr. Ramirez said that he hadn’t had a vacation in 3 years and not not bother them during Memorial Day weekend. Then they said they’d give me a drug to help my bladder muscles push out the urine but that was it. If I couldn’t pee after that, he said that they wanted nothing to do with me and they would refer me to a urologist... I’m unhappy with my depth... I’m happy I got out alive and maybe in another 10 years I can afford a revision surgery"*

* [Unethical trans doc exposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgender/comments/axjutw/unethical_trans_doc_exposed/) by neurophilos in Feb 2019, referring to [Unethical Trans Doc Exposed](https://www.transadvocate.com/unethical-trans-doc-exposed_n_26683.htm) in Trans Advocate.

Copies of what he posted on this Instagram account (now deleted).

* https://imgur.com/a/vGDwExB
* https://ibb.co/7KT2h4B

A few days later there was great discussion in /r/medicine amongst his peers showing that this is not representative of the medical profession and is not acceptable. Very accepting of trans people however.

* [Florida Man \[surgeon\] loses job after posting mid-surgery photos of his patients' genitals with mocking captions on Instagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/azeexx/florida_man_surgeon_loses_job_after_posting/) in March 2019

On June 8,  2005,  the Board ordered that Dr.  Raphael's Texas  medical  license be immediately suspended. The action was based on Dr. Raphael's failure  to comply with all  of the terms and conditions of an Order  Dr. Raphael  entered into ith the Board on December  12,  2003. Subsequently, and also on June 8,  the District  Court of the 353rd  Judicial  District in Travis County, Texas, entered an Order denying Dr. Raphael's application for a temporary restraining order against the enforcement of the Board's Order.*

On  12-12-03 the Board  and Dr.  Raphael  entered into an Agreed  Order  that included  a 45-day suspension,  public  reprimand,  and  probation  for  10 years. The action was based on a determination  of substandard  care that resulted  in 
the death of a patient receiving  multiple  plastic surgery  procedures.  The findings  of substandard  care included  issues with anesthesiology,  inadequate staffing, length of surgery  and  the high  volume  of liposuction  performed  in  an

As soon as I got out of surgery the swelling was horrific and I kept getting told it would go down 90% in two weeks... I was told that again two weeks later. Here at 3.5 weeks its as swollen as week 1 and I cant walk for more than 10 minutes. Aesthetically its horrifyingly bad. Went to get a second opinion by the grace of God from a trans healthcare doctor, who IMMEDIATELY noticed something was wrong IMMEDIATELY found abcesses and turns out per CT scan I have infection inside my labia going towards mon pubis and clitoris which is why the swelling was immense. They cultured it and apparently its a drug resistant bacteria called B fragilis."*
