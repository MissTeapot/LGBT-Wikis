    * [Update: SRS for Flying_Cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/819y4k/update_srs_for_flying_cat/) by Flying_Cat in 2018 - *"My primary surgeon was Valerie Lemaine at the Mayo Clinic, my secondary surgeon was Jorys Martinez-Jorges. My primary surgeon has since left the Mayo clinic and I don't think she's doing GRS at this point in time...  I cannot recommend Mayo Clinic in any way shape or form. I'm not so pissed that they fucked up on me, I'm livid they fucked up on every single patient I have met who had surgery +/- a year of me and in many of the exact same ways. Industry standard is ~80% fine after 1 surgery, From what I can tell, Mayo's was zero. They had 0 business providing GRS at the time... My complications fall into the following category: 1) Excessive erectile tisse left behind - this appeared near universal among the Mayo alumni I've known, myself included. 2) Urinary issues - can find at least one other person in this camp. Whenever I would pee, it would go to the right. 3) aesthetic - didn't look remotely cis 4) lingering phantom pain - felt like a testicle getting squeezed - that referred pain in the abdomen 5) major scarring - noticible scars. Depth was meh, 4.5". The revision is expected to take 4 weeks to heal. If Mayo's fuck ups required one weeks worth of downtime, okay but 4 weeks to fix all of the issues they left behind is completely unacceptable. I must give a hard pass on Mayo. There were also two nurses who either asked questions I feel were inappropriate or in one case, one nurse referred to me as "sir". She had just checked my chart so she knew why I was there."*

This is not true. You must completely clear the area with electrolysis beforehand or risk dealing with hair afterwards. Mayo leaves too much erectile tissue in. I and every review I have ever read of Mayo vaginoplasty have that complication. This is a functional and aesthetic (deformation) issue. It makes dilation difficult. It makes arousal uncomfortable and dysphoric. Overall, aesthetics are poor."*
