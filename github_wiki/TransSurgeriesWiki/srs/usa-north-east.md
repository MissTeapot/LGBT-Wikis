* reply to [Hair in vagina](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/zt4nwi/hair_in_vagina/j1d1amu/) by ImpressiveEffect8212 in 2022 - *"I am pre op, but I consulted with a surgeon (Dr Slama) who has had cases of internal hairs. He doesn‚Äôt follicle scrap, so any hairs not removed with electro in advance will return internally. Dr Slama said when that happens if there are few hairs not causing issues for the patient, he leaves it. If the amount of hair is noticeable, then he would do an outpatient revision procedure to use surgical electrocautery tooling to remove them (but said he can only remove small sections at a time and so isn‚Äôt perfect and may need to be repeated). He recommended being thorough with hair removal pre-op."*

I did not go with Dr Purohit to fix the fistula because 1) he could not schedule me until January, but mainly 2) because he was excessively pessimistic about the possible surgical outcomes (he said "I'm not sure how to fix it without ruining your vagina," and suggested having a whole new vagina made by sigmoid colon method). Honestly, this was an entirely avoidable emotional rollercoaster, and if you have similar issues I would suggest going to a urogynecological surgeon first over a urological surgeon who also does vaginoplasties.*"

Stories of confusion and courage, excitement and emotion that have never been told, until now. To anyone who has ever looked in a mirror and wondered, 'who they really are?' TRANS ask another question, 'are you brave enough to find out?'"*

She screwed up big time, and I haven't been able to pee since March 22nd, I have been forced to use a suprapubic catheter. It hurts and I don't like having to use it. But I can't find any surgeon who can fix it so I can pee normally....  Honest to God it hurts like hell and I don't want to be here anymore. I can't run, I can't have sex or be active. It hurts whenever I drink anything because my bladder is so screwed up and I feel broken... I'm just about done with this life. I hate being in pain every single day. And 6 months down the road I still haven't found a surgeon to fix this."*

As such it is growing harder and harder to stomach dialation, which makes dialation more difficult as I am skipping it too often, making it even more daunting, ect. I don't know how to get out of that loop. A big part of this is that I've only been able to have sex once in the two years since surgery and it was an immense struggle. I don't really know why, seems it's angled weird or something, if she did any post-op support maybe I would have an answer but she doesn't so I don't. I'm spending an hour a night reminded of how broken this body is and how much of a failure what was supposed to be the end of my transition was, all to keep open a canal I cannot use. It's so fucking hard, but stopping is such a permanent choice. It's shutting the door on this ever getting better. I don't want to stop but I don't know how to keep going. "*
