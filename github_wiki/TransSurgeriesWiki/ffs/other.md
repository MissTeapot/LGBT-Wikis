A November study from the Korea Medical Association released in November showed that some 750 South Korean doctors yearly‚Äîor an average of more than two per day‚Äîare criminally charged with professional negligence resulting in death or injury. That‚Äôs 14.7 times higher than the number of similar indictments in Japan, 580.6 times higher than in the UK, and 26.6 times higher than in Germany... Faith in hospitals and surgeons is particularly low due in large part to suspicions‚Äîbased on cases that have made the news‚Äîof unqualified staff mishandling operations. In 2021, the government required surveillance cameras be installed in operating rooms where patients are under general anesthesia to try to stamp down on malpractice cases... In terms of compensation, currently, victims of ‚Äúmedical mishaps‚Äù are allowed to claim up to 30 million won ($24,500), with 70% shouldered by the government and 30% by the institution or doctor responsible."*

Ghost surgery is not just limited to the cosmetic surgery field but also secretly performed in other fields of clinical medicine, and it happens in university-affiliated hospitals as well as private hospitals... However, although ghost surgery is apparently an act of undermining medical ethics at its core, there are no legal grounds to stop such activity in Korea as of yet."*

So after months of literally going through hoops to put the money together. Bit by bit and I paid it. The final thing was to find flights and I did. Paid for flights and accommodation and contacted the hospital... One last question I was asked before we lock in the surgery date .‚Äù are u allergic to anything or taking any medications?‚Äù Yeah, so I said no just my HIV medication. As I am HIV pos undetectable and healthy. Then that friendly representative from the hospital said sorry hospital policy we can‚Äôt accept HIV pos or undetectable patients. We will refund u ur money. And just like that she pissed all over my parade, dreams and surgery. Her welcoming way turned very to the point; borderline aggressive ‚Äúwhen I asked medical history no,6 and you did not say anything so I could not imagine that you have HIV...

&gt; I had an operation last year with this company www.hygieiaturkey.com. Esma Demirezen does not care about the patient aftercare whatsoever and has ruined many people's lives by choosing bad and greedy surgeons whilst taking commission from the operation and then denying any wrong work.   
&gt; Please avoid her company. You may contact me for photos or other information. I had a revision rhinoplasty (under her guidance) which was not needed, skull bone graft to fix cheekbone and chin/jaw adjustment which gave very bad results and I must suffer with these scars on my face for the rest of my life. When you ask her to fix it, she charges more consultation fees instead of abiding by the 100% patient satisfaction on her website. She only cares about money and should be banned from medical profession. I requested a female nurse after operation but woke up to a male nurse who looked after me whilst I was temporarily blinded for 3 days post-op due to bruising. She did not even care that she had ignored one simple request! And he was the only male nurse on the floor.    
&gt; My life is ruined because of her organisation and her denial of what she has done. The after-care experience was terrible. I was in pain and she didn't help. She was so obsessed with payment for operation that if I couldn't pay in full for the extra operations she suggested - I would have to walk to the ATM everyday and withdraw the money straight after the surgery!! She told me of an instance where her rhinoplasty patient had to visit the ATM every day for a week to withdraw the money for their operation as their bank transfer failed. Do you really want this person overseeing your health in a foreign country? Be warned! There are better doctors and more compassionate people in Turkey. Esma Demirezen is just in the medical industry for money!

* [Neda / Dr Ergin](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/zy63qx/neda_dr_ergin/) by Pomshka in 2023 - *This post isn't about them, it's about Neda himself... He was always posting saying if anyone has any questions or concerns to not hesitate to contact him. So I did. I explained that my father had some reservations and could he, Neda offer me any words to ease my dad's thoughts? ... I did not expect for Neda to reply, saying that he had cancelled my surgery, blocked/banned me from the hospital and saying that "I had taken the space of some other Trans person who could have had their surgery earlier and that the bad karma was on me"... Luckily I could cancel my hotel reservation with no charges but unfortunately my flight tickets were not refundable. So I've lost ¬£700.*
* [Transgender surgery by neda - my thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/yiyo1c/transgender_surgery_by_neda_my_thoughts/) in 2022 - *"The main problem is Neda himself. Once I got into the hospital room, he started telling me about other patients, there was no confidentiality... A few days after surgery, I woke up to my before and after photos posted to Instagram. I couldn‚Äôt believe he had actually posted them without asking me first... Not only this, but he can be rude over messages. One boy posted his experience on Facebook about how he was having some problems after his surgery, Neda told him to come back to the hospital for him to get checked out which resulted in the boy going back a few times through his stay. When it was time for his chest reveal, Neda was texting with another boy who had surgery around the same time and said the boy had been to the hospital 4 times and they don‚Äôt have time for his chest reveal as he and the doctor are ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù."*
