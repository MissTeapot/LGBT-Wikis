# INTRO

Transitioning and aging both come with plenty of difficulties. Having regular access to efficient HRT treatment methods is a tough challenge, often requiring money, insurance, and many expensive appointments with (hopefully) open-minded doctors. Even then, not all drugs are available in every country, and local pharmacies can offer more hurdles with gatekeeping or an inability to fill certain prescriptions. Therefore, many of us simply "DIY" - purchasing the medications from abroad, through somewhat questionable means. This is often insufficient, as meds can sometimes be seized at the border or delayed in shipping, and the quality controls of medications done outside the traditional pharmaceutical system are uncertain. The current online marketplaces for HRT have proven to be relatively reliable most of the time, but the level of trust is naturally higher for what someone can do and verify for themself at home, and making homemade goods means never having to deal with waiting times again. During the pandemic, many of us DIYers were affected by shipping delays and business shutdowns, so we decided to start doing things differently, by "seizing the means of production" in our own specific way.

Therefore, on [r/estrogel](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/) we talk about homebrewing HRT gel and spray for both feminizing and masculinizing effects - because we feel that HRT should be easy to obtain for everyone who needs it, and we don't want to take risks with ingesting possible hazards through pills, or even worse, injections that may not be completely sterile and could place harmful contaminants or viruses inside of your body. Your skin is the best barrier against infections and a lot of chemicals, so why not use it? Safety and simplicity are our top concerns, so we study existing patents, and try to devise better, simpler, and cheaper generics of existing drug. This is "guerrilla science". Our goal is simple: HRT should cost less than $1 USD per month, all inclusive, to be accessible to even the poorest among us. This means everyone without or unable to afford health insurance, those without regular access to healthcare, or those stuck in remote or less fortunate areas of the world.

We do not make money out of our research. We do not sell anything. We just share with you the recipes to reproduce medications and the sources for where we found the information to do so. The information is all free to use and share. Think of it as cooking: we tell you how you can make an apple pie, at home, by yourself. We discuss how to make your pie better, and cheaper than the pie you can buy at the supermarket. We tell you all about the risks of the various ingredients, and which ones you can decide to omit. We compare the original recipe published in your grandma's cookbook with the latest research by food scientists. Except you're on your own to get the most important part, the apples, and this isn't an apple pie you're making :) And yes, it's your own responsibility to wear [safety equipment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ7M01jV058 "why you should always wear gloves") and ensure that you properly measure and mix the ingredients (ideally with a [precision digital scale](https://www.amazon.com/slp/digital-weight-scale/jz4spvgfn5co59f "scales on Amazon") and a [magnetic stirrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stirrer "magnetic stirrer - Wikipedia"), but you could resort to something as cheap and simple as a [$3 milk frother](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/produkt-milk-frother-black-30301167/ "Ikea milk frother")), and to store them properly in safe, sterile, air-tight containers, protected from UV light, oxidation, or swings in heat and humidity. We are not responsible for anyone's actions, and you should always do your best to verify everything with external sources and consider your own safety before using any of the information found here. Estrogens and progestogens are not considered controlled narcotics in most countries (*testosterone and other compounds are, however*), but manufacturing your own medication, even just for personal use, may or may not be legal where you live, so please consider your local guidelines and use caution. Never do something if you are not comfortable with the risks that you are taking, and always try to minimize those risks.

At the moment, we are continuing to explore and compare various "plans" inspired by commercially available medications. We want to replicate them, and improve them to reach our goal. We talk about ways to verify the purity and the safety of the compounds before use, how to find supplies at the lowest costs, and how to make existing formulas more powerful and effective. We are already very close to breaking the psychological price barrier of $1 USD per month for feminizing HRT - [with one of our recipes for an estradiol spray (plan C), you can make enough estradiol solution to last you about 7 years for about $90 USD](https://github.com/MissTeapot/LGBT-Wikis/blob/main/github_wiki/estrogel/index#wiki_c_-_basic_estradiol_lenzetto_spray "plan c - estradiol spray".md) with an easily obtainable vodka base that already contains the optimal 60% ethanol mix for skin absorption.

We believe the best currently-available feminizing recipe (the spray listed above), which has been reverse-engineered from a product that's been in use since the 1970s, can be further improved using a recently-patented fatty acid mix that will further improve absorption by a factor of 28x, therefore further reducing the costs exponentially. With a decrease in costs by yet another order of magnitude, this could help us reach costs below the psychological barrier of $1 USD per year! This is extremely important in many parts of the world, where access to these sorts of treatments can be nearly impossible due to the financial constraints of crippling poverty in third world economies.

We care about ALL people (all of our transgender and non-conforming siblings, post-menopausal women, men with low-T, and all others who can benefit from this research), and we want everyone to have access to the help they need. If you can share information that could improve others' lives at any point, please do so! And, if this is also who you are, especially if you're educated in the fields of chemistry, biology, or pharmacology, please join our collective at [r/estrogel](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/) to help!

As time goes on, we'll try to keep all of the information here in this wiki comprehensive and up to date. Please let one of the mods know if there's anything you'd like to see added, or if you find any errors, miscalculations, or incomplete formulas (specifically, you can message [the group moderators directly](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/estrogel "message moderators") at any time, but please be patient with this constant work in progress), and we hope that you find this amalgamation of research data and recipes to be very helpful! &lt;3


# SAFETY AND PURITY TESTING

We'd like to offer you another reminder to always wear safety equipment (especially gloves) when handling any of the substances mentioned in these formulas, and to store them properly in safe, sterile, air-tight containers, protected from UV light, oxidation, or swings in heat and humidity. We are not responsible for anyone's actions, and you should always do your best to verify everything with external sources and consider your own safety before using any of the information found here. Estrogens and progestogens are not considered controlled narcotics in most countries (testosterone and other compounds are, however), but manufacturing your own medication, even just for personal use, may or may not be legal where you live, so please consider your local guidelines and use caution. Never do something if you are not comfortable with the risks that you are taking, and always try to minimize those risks. Also, consider the [possible risks of transferring these chemicals to others through physical contact](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hfcnxi/are_environmental_issues_a_factor_with_increased/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial spread thread"), and do your best to use these formulas in the safest manner possible, both for you and the people around you. Safety first!

Please check any ingredients that you plan to use for "denaturing agents," such as methanol or pyridine, which are poisonous if ingested. Such toxins can be very harmful through any route of ingestion - oral, transdermal, or otherwise. Only use a gel sanitizer base if it contains pure ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, and only use liquid alcohols that are specifically meant to be ingested by humans or used on human skin, such as everclear or pure isopropanol that does not contain any added denaturing or bittering agents.

It is always in your best interest to know what you're putting into your body. When manufacturing medications, we recommend that you have individual ingredients tested for purity. Again, SAFETY FIRST!!!

## Methods for testing at home

We are currently trying to evaluate different methods of chromatography to find if there is an easy way to test samples for purity and contaminants in a home environment. So far, we are looking into the possibilities of using either [high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gt2pwe/checking_the_quality_of_your_estrogel_by_hplc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "HPLC thread") or [thin layer chromatography (TLC)](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gt3d8q/thin_layer_chromatography_detection_of_steriods/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "TLC thread"), which could possibly be performed with just a camera, an arduino, and a UV LED. It is not yet clear if other options may work, such as [paper chromatography or fluorometry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/htw466/simple_paper_chromatography_test_for_estrogens/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "paper chromatography thread")

If you're looking for information on how blood serum level tests are performed or how to interpret the results of such tests, you can find resources detailing tests for [estrogens here](https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/84230 "estrogen blood tests") and [testosterone here.](https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/83686 "testosterone blood tests")

## Labs for testing

These are independent laboratories that are capable of testing samples for purity and contaminants. They are in no way affiliated with or endorsed by this subreddit, but we do encourage you to try to be as safe as possible, which includes researching the reputation of each laboratory before relying on their results. You might also consider speaking with individuals in the chemistry department at your local university who could have access to proper testing equipment.

# DOSAGE EQUIVALENCIES

The values listed herein are approximated equivalencies, compiled and deduced from several sources, and presented relative to cis-AGAB hormone levels. These values are estimations and should not be considered as gospel, nor as a replacement for dosages prescribed by a physician. Always try your hardest to monitor the amounts of each medication that you might be putting into your body, and pay close attention to the effects that your dosage levels yield, preferably with quantitative values based on lab results whenever possible. Remember to always start slow and safe with any new medication, and to discontinue use or seek medical help if you are feeling any negative effects.

## Estradiol

This table [is derived and extrapolated from data](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gir4y4/equivalent_doses_between_methods/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "equivalency thread") based on treatment of cisgender females experiencing hormonal deficiencies. For transgender women, higher doses may be needed to increase overall concentration to desired levels and should be considered situationally. For transdermal applications, total volume used per dose will be dependent on the concentration of estradiol in the solution.

***note: When preparing transdermal or sublingual applications, it is best to use plain 17 beta-estradiol powder (CAS 50-28-2). Do not use estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, or any other estradiol ester, as they do not absorb through the skin properly.***

# RESEARCH PLANS

## Feminizing treatments

Gels, sprays, tinctures, emulsions, and every other treatment method under the sun - we're taking them all on, trying to find better ways to make them all cheaply and safely at home, whether they're based around estradiol, estriol, or progesterone. If you want female hormones, but you don't want pills or pokes, this is the section for you!

***note: When preparing transdermal or sublingual applications, it is best to use plain 17 beta-estradiol powder (CAS 50-28-2). Do not use estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, or any other estradiol ester, as they do not absorb through the skin properly.***

#### A - Basic hand sanitizer estradiol gel

Since several gels seem to be comprised of 60% ethanol, carbomer, and trolamine as pH stabilizer, it should be possible to [just add some estradiol and maybe a penetration enhancer in a base of Purell](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/g7j5k1/plan_a_using_a_hydroalcoholic_sanitizing_hand_gel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial plan A thread"), however the use of denaturing agent could be a problem. More research is needed to find if the estradiol precipitates from this solution, but it is expected to remain shelf-stable indefinitely.

A regular-strength estradiol gel (0.06%) could be a simple as mixing 0.06 g (60 mg) of estradiol into 100 ml of 60% ethanol hand sanitizer gel. Dissolving the estradiol powder in a couple ml of ethanol before combining with the hand sanitizer could aid in mixing the solution evenly while bringing the overall ethanol content closer to [63%, which optimizes absorbency.](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2012.09.032 "steroid absorption - SciHub") For a double-strength estradiol gel (0.12%), instead use 0.12 g of estradiol (preferably dissolved with a couple ml of ethanol) in 100 ml of hand sanitizer gel.

#### B - Experimental supersaturated estradiol gel

We are trying to understand a patent that use an acid/ester mix to drive the hormones into the dermis, with more ester allowing for a longer half life, meaning a longer release, with a smaller volume, meaning it would be faster and easier to apply. This is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. We haven't mixed anything yet, we are currently trying to understand how it works. Please help us if you can.

https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gua29g/data_for_blood_levels_achievable_by_high_dose_gels/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

#### C - Basic estradiol spray

Another transdermal estradiol administration method that should be easy to replicate is the ["Lenzetto" spray that is commonly used in Europe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/g7lom3/plan_c_lenzetto_spray_instead_of_gel_just_using/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial plan C thread") Although it may require more effort to ensure consistent doses (as spray bottles are not always perfect and can get air trapped in the dispensation tube), the recipe should be exceedingly easy to replicate, and could even be produced to have higher concentrations or remove the penetration enhancers. So far, [the simplest formula](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gl2ima/status_report_on_homebrewing_estrogel_89_gets_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "everclear only plan C") lacks penetration enhancers, but should still produce several years worth of usable HRT spray (or tincture) by simply adding 7.5 g of estradiol powder to a 750 ml bottle of 120 proof Everclear or Vodka ([63% ethanol appears to result in the best absorption](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2012.09.032 "steroid absorption - SciHub"), so 60% alcohol should work just fine). For improved absorption, one could add a penetration enhancer, such as the commonly-used octisalate, which has proven effective in commercial products. A replication of the [currently-marketed 1.53 mg/dose transdermal spray](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gj8lfr/for_plan_c_solubility_of_estradiol_and_estriol/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "spray solubility thread") would include 1.7% estradiol and 8.5% octisalate, dissolved in ethanol (the other 89.8% of the mixture). The amount of octisalate used in commercial products is approximately 5-times the amount of estradiol used, so we will be developing formulas based on that 5:1 ratio. For 100 ml of a spray with a pretty typical concentration, similar to what is sold in pharmacies (approximately 1.53 mg of estradiol per dose), combine and mix the following:

* estradiol: 1.7 g
* octisalate: 8.5 g
* ethanol: 89.8 ml

It should be noted that [estradiol sprays do not deliver a linear increase in blood serum levels of estradiol](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gt6b3l/plan_c_multiple_doses_of_lenzetto_spray_do_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "diminishiing returns thread"), as additional sprays to the same location have diminishing results. It should, however, be possible to circumvent the diminishing returns of additional sprays by changing the location of administration or by [increasing the concentration of the spray](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gm23wz/plan_c_dosage_questions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "stronger spray thread"), as a single ml of ethanol can theoretically dissolve up to 20 mg of estradiol. For 100 ml of a double-strength spray (containing approximately 3%, or 3 mg of estradiol per dose), combine and mix about twice as much of each powder into slightly less ethanol as follows:

* estradiol: 3 g
* octisalate: 15 g
* ethanol: 82 ml

This double-strength spray is completely experimental, and the dosage efficacy has not yet been tested. The formula should not be harmful in any facet, but please proceed with caution.

Alternatively, [adding estradiol and octisalate to perfume spray](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hjteho/eau_de_cologne_spray/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial cologne thread") would be a suitable way to make a wonderful smelling transdermal application. The perfume could even stand to be watered down a bit, as most perfumes are about 80% alcohol and the best absorption rate is closer to 63%. 

#### D - Generic estradiol gel from scratch

We have found that it should be very easy to [make a generic version of the currently marketed estradiol gel](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/g5rckk/faq_for_the_estrogel_sub/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "sub FAQ thread") that is known to be safe and effective. Based on [patent US7404965, it appears that the original formula for commercial transdermal gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/g9x8kn/another_possible_generic_formula/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "gel patent thread") at regular strength (0.06%) is fairly simple:

* estradiol 0.06%
* lauryl alcohol 2.00%
* diethylene glycol mono ethyl ether (Transcutol P) 5.00%
* propylene glycol 6.00%
* ethyl alcohol 44.57%
* distilled water 39.55%
* Carbomer (Carbopol 980 NF) 1.21%
* triethanolamine 0.35%
* disodium EDTA 0.06%

The patent notes that estradiol can be up to a 3.00% concentration in this formula. However, we can make a comparable formula much easier, with fewer ingredients, and it should still be able to deliver estradiol well at the same concentration levels. The formula below is for a very simple double-strength gel (0.12%).

For 100 grams of estradiol gel at 0.12%, dissolve these in order, making sure you have the correct amount of each first:

* 17 beta-estradiol (active principle): 0.12 g 
* ethanol (lower alcohol, could also be isopropanol): 59 ml (60% alcohol seems to have the best absorption tendencies) 
* add purified water: 38.53 ml (or enough to bring overall formula to 100 ml after adding final ingredients)
* carbomer 980 (thickener or gelling agent, could also be carboxymethylcellulose or another polyacrylic acid like 934P or maybe even sepimax zen, with some adaptation of the recipe): 1 g 
* [triethanolamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triethanolamine "triethanolamine - Wikipedia") (neutralizing agent for the carbomer): 1.35 g

This stripped-down formula was derived from information found on page 39, line 171 of [this patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20070154533A1/en "steroid concentration patent"), as is similar to the US product Estreva 0.1%, and from line 261 of
[this other patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190160077A1/en "pharmaceutical compositions patent"), which is similar to the UK product EstroGel 0.06% (but the above recipe would have twice the concentration of estradiol, therefore needing half of the volume to deliver the same dose).

#### E - Experimental emulsions for estradiol, estriol, progesterone, or spironolactone

An emulsion may be a suitable [method of administration for progesterone and estriol](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/ghd5cq/plan_e_a_simple_emulsion/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial plan E thread"), or even for administering estradiol or spironolactone. More research on this topic is needed, but [here are two of the formulas that have been used commercially for spironolactone administration](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gz6nwr/for_plan_e_and_f_how_to_make_liposomes_or_water/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "emulsion how-to thread"), as described by their manufacturers:

&gt;"Spironolactone-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (SL-NLCs) were prepared by an emulsion solvent diffusion and evaporation method followed by ultrasonication, as reported by Eskandari et al10 but with slight modification. Fifty milligrams of SL was dispersed in the liquid lipid (olive oil alone or containing 50% Transcutol®) then added to molten Compritol® at 5% or 15% levels with respect to total solid lipid in the formulation. Following that, 10 mL of acetone and ethanol mixture (1:1) was added to the lipids maintained in a water bath at 80°C until complete dissolution of lipids in the organic phase. The latter was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing Tween 80 (1% or 2%) at 80°C and mixed using a magnetic stirrer rotating at 1,000 rpm for 1 minute. The resulting pre-emulsion was then ultrasonicated for 3 minutes to produce an oil/water nanoemulsion that was cooled down at room temperature while stirring at 500 rpm until evaporation of the organic solvent to form SL-NLC dispersion."

And:

&gt;"Plain methylcellulose (MC) gel (1%, w/v) was prepared by gently dispersing the required amount of MC in 100 mL of boiling deionized water, followed by magnetic stirring at a high speed. Stirring was continued until a thin, lump-free hazy dispersion was obtained. The gel was left overnight in the refrigerator. To prepare SP LeciPlex-loaded gel, a given weight of the LeciPlex F1 pellet obtained after centrifugation of the LeciPlex dispersion was mixed with a given weight of MC plain gel (1%, w/v). Control SP gel was prepared by adding a given weight of SP to 100 mL of boiling deionized water, followed by the addition of the required MC weight, and the rest of the process was the same as the plain gel. SP concentration in all of the preparations was 1%, w/v."

#### F - Experimental estriol hydrogel (for vaginal use)

Estriol has been shown to have some rejuvenative properties, due to a change in the collagen and elastin content of the skin. This principle has been used by some to rejuvenate the appearance of the skin on their hands and face, and [the same principle could theoretically be used](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/ghcc8r/why_not_use_estriol_to_help_dilation_post_srs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "estriol dilation thread") to lessen scarring and aid in dilation of the neovagina after sexual reassignment surgery. Because alcohol should not be used inside of the vagina, we are exploring the possibility of [using cyclodextrins or hypromellose to create a hydrogel](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/ghf2yt/plan_f_an_hydrogel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial plan f thread") that would release biologically active compounds through intravaginal application. Research on this topic is scarce.

#### FU - Experimental estradiol tincture (estro-booze)

Given that estradiol absorbs into the body at similar dosage rates with transdermal gels as it does through sublingual or buccal administration, it should be [fairly simple to concoct an estradiol tincture](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gl4q0i/plan_f_a_drinkable_cocktail_yummy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial plan FU thread") that could be administered [either sublingually or transdermally.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gl9qmd/sublingual_administration_of_ethanol_solution_of/ "sublingual tincture thread") By adding 7.5 g of estradiol to a 750 ml bottle of either 120 proof everclear or 80 proof vodka (60% alcohol is optimal for absorption, but 40% should still be plenty effective while limiting any burning sensations), you get a 10 mg/ml solution (1% estradiol), and only a few drops would be needed for each dose. The solution would be safe to consume while greatly diminishing the risk of others being inadvertently contacted by the dose, and octisalate could be used to further increase the speed and effectiveness of absorption when applied on the skin, while penetration enhancers appear to be completely [unnecessary during sublingual or buccal administration.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/guwb1k/starting_to_look_at_trans_mucosal_delivery/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "transmucosal penetration thread") Please remember to always mark your medications clearly, especially when they could appear to others to be a fun alcoholic cocktail, as unintended consumption or extreme doses could cause health complications! ***Do NOT use rubbing alcohol or anything else that could be toxic!***

Alternatively, a sublingual microemulsion could be created with a [base of propylene glycol](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hu9t8x/oral_sublingual_solution/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "sublingual propylene glycol thread") for those who cannot or choose not to use alcoholic drinks or who wish to experiment with extreme potencies.

#### H - Experimental enhanced-penetration recipes from the steroid community

For decades, there has been an [international community of steroid users that have gradually refined a transdermal formula that may suit our purposes](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gt9zr3/plan_h_exploring_the_mix_used_by_steroid_juicers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial plan H thread"). They have crafted this recipe largely through trial and error over a long time (from an initial time-tested recipe of 60% isopropyl alcohol, 30% isopropyl miristrate, and 10% oleic acid), and many people have contributed to tweaking the formula: 

* 40% isopropyl alcohol or ethanol (99%) 
* 15% isopropyl miristrate 
* 15% isopropyl palmitate 
* 10% oleic acid 
* 10% propylene glycol 
* 10% DMSO 

If you want to make this into a gel solution instead of a spray, first combine carbomer with the isopropyl miristrate and some d-Limonene, then let the mixture sit for at least 15 minutes to minimize clumping in the full solution. You may need to add more d-Limonene later in the process to prevent stratification of the final product. The pH range should be maintained at 7.0-7.4 and should be checked by accurate means. It should also be noted that DMSO carries certain potential health risks, so please exercise caution. If you'd like to avoid using DMSO, there is another recipe floating around: 

* 50% isopropyl alcohol or ethanol (99%) 
* 25% isopropyl miristrate 
* 10% oleic acid 
* 10% propylene glycol 
* 5%  glycerol 

The Glycerol seems superfluous, and may be a placeholder for the DMSO, as the 10% PG would already make the solution greasy enough to perform like a moisturizer.

#### Further experimentation - Application sites, "stop-and-go" method, and different topical uses

Theoretically, a lot of the research done for the various transdermal products that are discussed in this subreddit could be expanded to use in [other, non-hormone related serums and creams for the application of many different health or cosmetic compounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/h90l9b/what_about_using_the_same_science_for_skin_creams/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial skin cream thread"), like B, [C, and E](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hcvhah/my_first_attempt_ow_microemulsion_for_vitamin_c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "vitamin c and e thread") vitamins, [topical painkiller creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hb2tx9/totally_unrelated_an_ibuprofen_gel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial painkiller thread"), or even [complex anti-aging creams.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/fibnrj/the_current_compendium_of_my_compounded_topical/ "Dr. Powers anti-aging cream") There is research ongoing into the possible formulation of a [topical serum that may have effects to reduce the size of sebaceous glands](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gvhvoq/idea_for_reducing_pore_size_sebaceous_glands_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial sebaceous topical thread"), which could minimize both sebum production and the appearance of facial pores. It appears that triethanolamine, which is used in many formulas as a neutralizing agent for the various necessary carbomers, can be [useful for cleansing sebaceous follicles and helping to prevent acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15850295/ "Carbo &amp; Trieth vs Sebum - PubMed"). These theories are based in fairly old research, but these avenues have not been properly explored until now.

We are also experimenting with different uses, application sites, and timing of doses, and their efficacies relative to current commonly prescribed practices. It appears that the currently prescribed application sites for transdermal estradiol were [chosen based more on minimizing cancer risk than on effectiveness of absorbtion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gvjx83/why_are_some_sites_recommended_for_estrogel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial application site thread") It is hypothesized, therefore, that transgender women with a substantially lower risk of developing breast cancer could theoretically apply estradiol solutions directly to the breasts to stimulate growth, though this idea is widely disputed. It has also been proposed that, for women who have experienced minimal or stalled growth after significant time on HRT, [cycling off and back on to HRT medications might be able to re-engage growth production](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gqsh2g/a_practical_use_of_estrogel_as_a_topical_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial cycling thread") better than simply increasing dosage, based on theories about receptor desensitization, dosage derivatives, and growth retention. We are also examining the effects of added [growth hormone secretagogues relative to various estradiol administration methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gz97v7/effect_of_transdermal_estrogens_on_igf1_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial GH thread"), as it appears that oral estradiol has a negative overall effect on IGF-1, while other administration routes like transdermal or sublingual could possibly have better results, potentially depending on timing or cycling of the secretagogue doses. This particular subject is still vastly under-researched and highly controversial, as it is still unknown what exact combination of biological mechanisms may be responsible for starting, stopping, and maintaining breast growth. It is hypothesized that [TGF-beta may have a negative role in regards to both breast growth and the appearance of aging](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hxu5cf/on_the_role_of_tgfbeta/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial TGF-beta thread"), so TGF-beta inhibitors could potentially improve results in both categories. Additionally, some folks are looking into how best to combine [estradiol with a topical hair-growth formula](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hfd7jc/estradiol_in_minoxidil_topical/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial minoxidil thread") to reverse male-pattern baldness, or [how to do so with only an estradiol gel.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hyosse/estrogel_or_other_topical_estradiol_against_male/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "estradiol baldness thread")

Also on the horizon, is the possibility of [reverse-engineering transdermal hormone patches](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/h094rg/home_made_transdermal_patches/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial patches thread"), for those who may be interested in making their own, or the potential for [microemulsions which could affect the redistribution of subcutaneous and visceral fat](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hwa83s/a_thiazolidinediones_microemulsion_for_fat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "fat redistribution thread") or [even facial fat through a topical application.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hxb5q9/a_prostaglandine_microemulsion_for_fat_resorption/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "topical fat redistribution thread") Some of the ingredients that may lead to the fat redistribution effects carry significant health dangers and possible medical complications, however, and these formulations should not be used without a full understanding of the risks involved in utilizing such substances which could be hazardous.


## Masculinizing treatments

FTMs can substitute testosterone or DHT for estradiol in some of the above formulas, but they need to add a penetration enhancer, such as a small amount of isopropyl myristate.

Please also check [this patent for dihydrotestosterone gel](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1317921B1/en "dihydrotestosterone gel patent") if you need more details about how andractim is made, be sure to read from line 47 explaining how to make a 70kg batch and adjust the volumes depending on how much you want to make.

We are looking at 2 alternative plans for both more concentration (plan Z) and for a spray (plan Y).

#### Z - Experimental supersaturated DHT gel

There is a concept for a [low-alcohol DHT gel that could be applied to the face and groin](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/g9i3cy/plan_z_supersaturated_dht_gel_using_acid_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial plan Z thread") to stimulate growth of facial hair and genitalia. It appears that [genital skin may absorb such formulas more effectively than the skin on the forearm.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/h81usg/for_plan_z_trans_men_can_use_vulvar_application/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "genital application thread") This is very experimental, as there has been very little research in this field, however, a possible formula could be a simple as combining the following in order, stirring in each ingredient and mixing completely after adding each one:

* DHT: desired concentration
* water: 90%
* propylene glycol (co-solvent): 5%
* oleic acid: 2%
* ethyl oleate (fatty acid ester): 2%
* carbomer 934 (gelling agent): 1% or as needed for desired consistency
* remember to stir in each ingredient and to mix the solution completely each time something else is added

#### Y - DHT spray

It should be [relatively easy to create a spray to release DHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/g9j8sv/plan_y_a_dht_spray_for_guys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial plan Y thread") by following the following formula to create 70 grams of spray:

* ethanol 95%: 49 g
* isopropyl myristate: 0.5 g
* DHT: 0.5 g
* mix well before adding water
* water: 20 g, mixed in last to complete the solution

Another possible [formula for a testosterone spray](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hy4wkt/a_testosteronecontaining_topical_spray_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "T spray thread") could be created by mixing appropriate ratios of testosterone (50mg/ml), methyl-testosterone (10mg/ml), and DMSO into a solvent base, such as ethanol.

#### X - Topical DHT for hair growth

A patent was uncovered that highlights the potential for a [topical application of DHT to promote the growth of facial and body hair.](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/hyzf90/topical_dht_patented_for_beard_growth/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "topical DHT thread") 
&gt; (DHT could be) used alone or in fixed combination with other hair growth medications, including other androgens, bimatoprost, other prostamides, prostaglandins, minoxidil or apocrine hair growth factors to promote and enhance hair growth of terminal mustache hair, beard hair, also chest hair, and other male androgen sensitive or dependent hair growth in humans or animals.


## Hormone Suppressants 

#### 1 - Experimental tamoxifen gel

There is research showing that [transdermal application of tamoxifen is significantly safer than oral consumption](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gvk4tu/possible_expansion_of_gel_for_nbs_transdermal_4oh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x "initial tamoxigel thread"), while still maintaining efficacy. More research needs to be done, and much caution should be used, as tamoxifen carries potential risks.
