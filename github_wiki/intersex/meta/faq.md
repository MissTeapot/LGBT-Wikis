## About Intersex In General
___

### What is intersex?
&gt;Intersex people are individuals born with any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones or genitals that, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, "do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies". Such variations **may** involve genital ambiguity and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female.

### Can I become intersex? What is the difference between salmacian, transgender, and intersex?
Sometimes words and terms can become difficult to tell apart, especially for newcomers. While intersex are born with a condition (affecting any of several variations in sex characteristics) salmacian are people who actively thrive to get primary sex characteristics of both binary worlds. Salmacian folk can be intersex, if they are born with an intersex condition, but cannot become intersex by taking part in surgeries.

While salmacian and intersex both deal with the idea of physical sexes the term "transgender" deals with the biological world of gender identity. All available evidence points towards a biologically determined identity. In transgender people you would say there was a mismatch in the testosterone milieu during the development of the body and then during development of the brain, so that the body was masculinized and the brain was feminized, or the other way around. (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/46/15466). Trans* people can but don't necessarily need to attend gender alignment surgeries to be valid.

### Am I intersex?
Maybe! Maybe not. We know that this question is very loaded and emotional, but it should definitely be a question to ask your doc about. Especially if you feel like needing medical help or immediate assistance, call an ambulance instead of posting it here.

### Is PCOS an intersex condition?

Although controversial we do consider it to be part of the intersex umbrella.

### Can you help me find a doctor for diagnosis?
To be diagnosed with an intersex condition, you'll probably need to see an endocrinologist.  
We recommend using the [Hormone.org](https://www.hormone.org/find-an-endocrinologist) tool for searching which allows you to specify areas of concentration.

### I am trans - does this make me intersex?
(Sex â‰  Gender) It is a common misconception to confuse intersex and trans experiences. We share some, but being intersex doesn't make you trans. Same as being trans does not make you intersex. However it is very much possible to have an intersex condition and be trans at the same time. For some of us this is a very painful reality when the individual got altered as an infant without consent only to realize later in life to re-alter what got forced upon them.

### Can I identify as intersex?
Well, are you intersex? If you are, then yes of course you can "identify" with it.

### What are common intersex symptoms?
* Ambiguous or undersized genitalia at birth including micropenis, enlarged clitoris, fused labia, or other such issues.  
* Hypospadias, a condition where the urethral ending isn't in the head of the penis but the underside.
* Issues around the time of natural puberty, such as delayed (or absent) hormones, receiving the opposite hormones than you 'should'.  
If you think you're showing symptoms of intersexuality, the best bet is to be seen by a specialist.

### What are some of the intersex conditions?
We suggest researching this using the [ISNA conditions page](https://isna.org/faq/conditions/) which includes way more information than we can provide in this FAQ.

### Are slurs allowed on this sub?
No and especially inter* or trans* related slurs can get one banned from this sub.

### Help! My child is intersex.
What wonderful news that is! Please treat them as the fabulous human being they are and tell them that it is okay to be intersex. No unnecessary surgeries needed. If they come up with questions which you do not know the answer to, please feel free to ask these questions here on this sub - we would be happy to answer them.

## About /r/Intersex

###What are the subreddit rules?  
* No Bigotry: We're here to support intersex lives, but this also goes as far as other marginalized groups. Furthering the marginalization of ANYONE here will result in a ban.

* Research &amp; Surveys: Anyone looking to post surveys or requests for intersex people to provide info for research should send a reddit message to /r/intersex first, make sure to include your questions.

* No Exclusion: Arguments over who is or isn't intersex should be kept to private messages or off of the subreddit. Polite explanations of what aren't or are intersex are acceptable, however.

* Sexualized Content: This is not the place for sexualized or titillating content. Discussions about biology and issues related to intersex conditions are fine, but keep your sexual content on your Onlyfans. Needless to say any content fetishizing or 'chasing' intersex people is unwelcome.

* Graphical Nudity/Pictures: Please don't post pictures of your genitalia or nude body here. You can discuss your body and issues, but unwarranted pictures are unwanted.

* "Am I Intersex?" posts shouldn't be posted, because we can't give you a yes or no - we can only tell you to see a doctor. There are resources in the FAQ linked above.

* The "H"-Word: Don't use it. It has a really rough history of abuse and is used in fetishizing intersex people. It has no place in use when discussing human people and our bodies. Want to reclaim it? Use it anywhere but here.

### Are _blank_ allowed here?
We welcome Intersex and Perisex/Dyadic (so called 'normal') people alike, including cisgender, transgender, non-binary and anyone in-between.  Anyone who comes here with a respectful attitude is welcome. Sometimes people who aren't Intersex are prone to making assumptive leaps or falling into social pitfalls in interacting with intersex people - so long as you attempt to remain respectful, you won't have any problems here.

###Someone insulted me or was otherwise very rude, what should I do?
Feel free to report the post, and/or send a modmail and we'll look into it. If nobody gets back to you within 24 hours, please post one of the mod names in response, either /u/ButINeedThatUsername, u/aka_icegirl, or /u/A7Guitar. 

###Is dyadic/perisex/non-intersex focused hate allowed here?
Absolutely not. If you see it please follow the steps above to contact a moderator, or report it to reddit at https://www.reddit.com/report
