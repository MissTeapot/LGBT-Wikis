# LGBT-Wikis!

These are all subreddit wiki's for LGBT+ subreddits listed below. They have had all of their internal links replaced with links pointing to this repository. That means that all this knowledge won't be lost if these subreddits decide to close indefinitely due to the API changes. It also has the advantage over archiving in that these files are completely changeable (i.e. they can be kept up-to-date)! Please do with these files what you want. I just what the information to be out there and help people.

Click on any of the subreddit names here to go to their wiki in this repo and be free of Reddit.

Thanks to Shreyas Minocha's [Reddit wiki cloner](https://git.sr.ht/~shreyasminocha/clone-reddit-wiki), I was easily able to download the markdown files. I simply changed the internal hyperlinks to link this repo instead of to Reddit with `fix_links.py` as well as quite a bit of manual fixing of headers and such. The original files I downloaded can be found the the `original` folder. These were downloaded on the 16th of June 2023.
